It increased the Lighthouse performance score an average of _8_ points from <em>87.2</em> to <em>95.2</em>!</p><p>These results were unexpected, when I shared them on Twitter both <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mathias">Mathias Bynens</a> asked me write it up... so here we are.</p><a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Introduction</h2></a><p>When doing Server-side Rendering (a.k.a SSR) it is common practice to render HTML and "<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#rehydration">rehydrate</a>" it in the browser using Preact or React.</p><p>Often times, this also requires you transfer the current application state to the browser, somehow. That way, when your application spins up in the browser, it can rehydrate with all the state it had on the server.</p><p>Most of my experience with doing this as a consultant is with <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>. And, in my experience these Redux state dumps can easily get <em>way too big</em>... but I digress.</p><p>The best strategy is always to <em>minimize their size to begin with</em>. But, there are certain cases where that is difficult to do beyond a certain point, and plenty of other cases where things have already gotten out of hand and you're just trying to make thing better.</p><p>There are three predominant mechanisms (that I'm aware of) for doing this "state transfer."</p><p>They are:</p><a name="option-1-turn-your-state-in-to-a-js-object-literal" class="anchor" href="#option-1-turn-your-state-in-to-a-js-object-literal"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Option #1: Turn your state in to a JS object literal</h2></a><p>This means that on the server-side you do something like <em>JSON.stringify(store.getState())</em> and you end up with HTML that includes a script tag like this.</p><pre><code class="undefinedhtml">&lt;script&gt;
  window.__REDUX__ = { some: "value", someOther: "value and so on" };
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>For this approach to work you also have to be careful about not including anything in your JSON that would make the browser think the script tag was terminating. So some extra escaping may be in order (<a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/etago">learn more here</a>). Additionally, using the result of <em>JSON.stringify()</em> directly in JS source code was a potential security issue until recently, since JSON strings could contain certain characters that were invalid in JS strings. More recently, this has been addressed with a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-superset">spec-level proposal that made it into ES2019</a>.</p><p>But, as you'll see you probably won't want to use this approach anyway since it's the slowest option.</p><p>When this executes in the browser what was JSON on the server-side is treated and parsed by the browser as a JS object literal. No different than if you have written code like this, without the quoted key names:</p><pre><code class="undefinedhtml">&lt;script&gt;
  window.__REDUX__ = { some: "value", someOther: "value and so on" };
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>But, it just has a few extra double quotes.</p><p>The important point in this case is that the data itself is parsed <em>as if it were JavaScript</em>.</p><a name="option-2-turn-your-state-into-an-quotinertquot-script" class="anchor" href="#option-2-turn-your-state-into-an-quotinertquot-script"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Option #2: Turn your state into an "inert" script</h2></a><p>Browsers only will parse the contents of a <em>&lt;script&gt;</em> tag if its type is <em>"module"</em>, <em>"text/javascript"</em>, or another <a href="https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-mime-type">recognized JS MIME type</a>, or well... it doesn't have a <em>type</em> specified at all. So the point is <em>anything else you specify as a type</em> means its contents will be ignored.</p><p>People use this for all manner of trickery, but it can also be used to transfer Redux state with a bit less escaping, but again, you still need to escape for stuff like <em>&lt;/script</em> to protect against XSS issues.</p><p>Some people like to to give it a valid MIME type to make themselves feel better but... browser don't care.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code class="undefinedhtml">&lt;script id="myState" type="application/json"&gt;
  {"your": "state", "goes": "here"}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>Then you can later parse it by grabbing the element out of the DOM and parsing its contents in some other script like so:</p><pre><code class="undefinedjs">window.__REDUX__ = JSON.parse(
  querySelector("myState").innerHTML
);
</code></pre><p>Unlike approach #1, in this case, the browser <em>never interprets the data as JavaScript</em> it merely parses a string as JSON, which is a much stricter data type, which as it turns out, is much faster.</p><p><em>However</em>, this approach means that the browser first has to create a DOM element with a lot of text in it and <em>then</em> you have to read that text from the DOM. This, as it turns out, is not without performance overhead of its own (results below).</p><a name="option-3-turn-your-state-into-js-string-containing-escaped-json" class="anchor" href="#option-3-turn-your-state-into-js-string-containing-escaped-json"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Option #3: Turn your state into JS String containing escaped JSON.</h2></a><p>What you do end up with in your HTML is this:</p><pre><code class="undefinedhtml">&lt;script&gt;
  window.__REDUX__ = JSON.parse("{\"some\":\"state\",\"other\":\"value\"}");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>As it turns out, this is <em>way</em> faster than the other options.</p><p>It may look a bit funny, but you still end up with a JS object. <em>However</em>, the key difference is that the contents of the data you're sending is <em>never interpreted as if it were code</em>. It's just a long JavaScript string literal, as far as the JavaScript parser is concerned. But, at runtime, it's <em>parsed as JSON</em> and becomes a JS object instance just like all the other approaches.</p><p><strong>A quick note on how I generated the JSON string:</strong> It turns out, it's not so easy to do this correctly, especially if you're including data from an API that you may not have full control over. Avoiding XSS is important here.</p><p>Anyway, again <a href="https://twitter.com/mathias/status/1143784574159347712">thanks to Mathias</a>, I ended up doing the following in node.js on the server-side to generate that string in a way that's safe to assume can be treated like a JavaScript string. I'm using his excellent: <a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jsesc">jsesc library</a> as well as his advice to do roughly something like this:</p><pre><code class="undefinedjs">const jsesc = require("jsesc");

// assume `data` here is the data we want to transfer
module.exports = data =&gt; {
  const jsonString = jsesc(JSON.stringify(data), {
    json: true,
    isScriptContext: true
  });

  return `
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      ... stuff here
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;div id='js-app'&gt;${allTheAppHTML}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;window.__REDUX_STATE__ = JSON.parse(${jsonString})&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src='/my-app.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
  `;
