What follows is essentially that talk as a blog post (I‚Äôll add a link to the video once it is published).</em></p><p><em>Also: the Starbucks PWA mentioned in the talk has shipped! üéâ</em></p><p>I‚Äôm <em>not</em> going to tell you what to do. Instead, I‚Äôm going to explain why I‚Äôve chosen to bet my whole career on this crazy Web thing. "Betting" sounds a bit haphazard, it‚Äôs more calculated than that. It would probably be better described as "investing."</p><p>Investing what? Our time and attention.</p><p>Many of us only have maybe 6 or so <em>really</em> productive hours per day when we‚Äôre capable of being super focused and doing our absolute best work. So how we chose to invest that very limited time is kind of a big deal. Even though I really enjoy programming I rarely do it aimlessly just for the pure joy of it. Ultimately, I‚Äôm investing that productive time expecting to get <em>some kind of return</em> even if it‚Äôs just mastering something or solving a difficult problem.</p><a name="quotso-what-whats-your-pointquot" class="anchor" href="#quotso-what-whats-your-pointquot"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>"So what, what‚Äôs your point?"</h2></a><blockquote><blockquote><p>More than most of us realize we are <em>constantly</em> investing</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Sure, someone may be paying for our time directly but there‚Äôs more to it than just trading hours for money. In the long run, what we chose to invest our professional efforts into has other effects:</p><p><strong>1. Building Expertise:</strong> We learn as we work and gain valuable experience in the technologies and platform we‚Äôre investing in. That expertise impacts our future earning potential and what types of products we‚Äôre capable of building.</p><p><strong>2. Building Equity:</strong> Hopefully we‚Äôre generating equity and adding value to whatever product we‚Äôre building.</p><p><strong>3. Shaping tomorrow‚Äôs job market:</strong> We‚Äôre building tomorrow‚Äôs legacy code today‚Ñ¢. Today‚Äôs new hotness is tomorrow‚Äôs maintenance burden. In many cases the people that initially build a product or service are not the ones that ultimately maintain it. This means the technology choices we make when building a new product or service, determine whether or not there will be jobs later that require expertise in that particular platform/technology. So, those tech choices <em>literally shape tomorrow‚Äôs job market!</em></p><p><strong>4. Body of knowledge:</strong> As developers, we‚Äôre pretty good at sharing what we learn. We blog, we "Stack-Overflow", etc. These things all contribute to the corpus of knowledge available about that given platform which adds significant value by making it easier/faster for others to build things using these tools.</p><p><strong>5. Open Source:</strong> We solve problems and share our work. When lots of developers do this it adds <em>tremendous value</em> to the technologies and platforms these tools are for. The sheer volume of work that we <em>don‚Äôt have to do</em> because we can use someone else‚Äôs library that already does it is mind-boggling. Millions and millions of hours of development work are available to us for free with a simple <code>npm install</code>.</p><p><strong>6. Building apps for users on that platform:</strong> Last but not least, without apps there is no platform. By making more software available to end users, we‚Äôre contributing significant value to the platforms that run our apps.</p><p>Looking at that list, the last four items are not about <em>us</em> at all. They represent other significant long-term impacts.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>We often have a broader impact than we realize</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>We‚Äôre not just investing time into a job, we're also shaping the platform, community, and technologies we use.</p><p>We‚Äôre going to come back to this, but hopefully, recognizing that greater impact can help us make better investments.</p><a name="with-all-investing-comes" class="anchor" href="#with-all-investing-comes"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>With all investing comes <em>risk</em></h2></a><p>We can‚Äôt talk about investing without talking about risk. So what are some of the potential risks?</p><a name="are-we-building-for-the-right-platform" class="anchor" href="#are-we-building-for-the-right-platform"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Are we building for the right platform?</h2></a><p>Platform stability is indeed A Thing‚Ñ¢. Just ask a Flash developer, Windows Phone developer, or Blackberry developer. Platforms <em>can</em> go away.</p><p>If we look at those three platforms, what do they have in common? They‚Äôre <em>closed</em> platforms. What I mean is there‚Äôs a single controlling interest. When you build for them, you‚Äôre building for a specific operating system and coding against a particular implementation as opposed to coding against a set of <em>open standards</em>. You could argue, that at least to some degree, Flash died because of its "closed-ness". Regardless, one thing is clear from a risk mitigation perspective: open is better than closed.</p><p>the Web is <em>incredibly</em> open. It would be quite difficult for any one entity to kill it off.</p><p>Now, for Windows Phone/Blackberry it failed due to a lack of interested users... or was it lack of interested developers??</p><div class="center"><img src="/images/2/ballmer.jpg" width="320" height="180"></div><p>Maybe if Ballmer ‚òùÔ∏è has just yelled "developers" <em>one more time</em> we‚Äôd all have Windows Phones in our pockets right now üòú.</p><p>From a risk mitigation perspective, two things are clear with regard to platform stability:</p><ol><li>Having <em>many users</em> is better than having few users</li><li>Having <em>more developers</em> building for the platform is better than having few developers</li></ol><blockquote><blockquote><p>There is no bigger more popular open platform than the Web</p></blockquote></blockquote><a name="are-we-building-the-right-software" class="anchor" href="#are-we-building-the-right-software"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Are we building the right software?</h2></a><p>Many of us are building apps. Well, we used to build "applications" but that wasn‚Äôt nearly cool enough. So now we build "apps" instead üòé.</p><p>What does "app" mean to a user? This is important because I think it‚Äôs changed a bit over the years. To a user, I would suggest it basically means: "a thing I put on my phone."</p><p>But for our purposes I want to get a bit more specific. I‚Äôd propose that an app is really:</p><ol><li>An "ad hoc" user interface</li><li>That is local(ish) to the device</li></ol><p>The term "ad hoc" is Latin and translates to <strong>"for this"</strong>. This actually matches pretty closely with what Apple‚Äôs marketing campaigns have been teaching the masses:</p><blockquote><p>There‚Äôs an app <strong>for that</strong></p><p>‚Äì Apple</p></blockquote><p>The point is it helps you <em>do</em> something. The emphasis is on action. I happen to think this is largely the difference between a "site" and an "app". A news site for example has articles that are resources in and of themselves. Where a news app is software that runs on the device that helps you consume news articles.</p><p>Another way to put it would be that site is more like a book, while an app is a tool.</p><a name="should-we-be-building-apps-at-all" class="anchor" href="#should-we-be-building-apps-at-all"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Should we be building apps at all?!</h2></a><p>Remember when chatbots were supposed to take over the world? Or perhaps we‚Äôll all be walking around with augmented reality glasses and that‚Äôs how we‚Äôll interact with the world?</p><p>I‚Äôve heard it said that "the future app is <em>no</em> app" and virtual assistants will take over everything.</p><div class="center"><img src="/images/2/echo.png" width="360" height="372"></div><p>I‚Äôve had one of these sitting in my living room for a couple of years, but I find it all but useless. It‚Äôs just a nice bluetooth speaker that I can yell at to play me music.</p><p>But I find it very interesting that:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Even Alexa has an app!</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Why? Because there‚Äôs no screen! As it turns out these "ad hoc visual interfaces" are extremely efficient.</p><p>Sure, I can yell out "Alexa, what‚Äôs the weather going to be like today" and I‚Äôll hear a reply with high and low and whether it‚Äôs cloudy, rainy, or sunny. But in that same amount of time, I can pull my phone out tap the weather app and before Alexa can finish telling me those 3 pieces of data, I can visually scan the entire week‚Äôs worth of data, air quality, sunrise/sunset times, etc. It‚Äôs just <em>so much more</em> efficient as a mechanism for consuming this type of data.</p><p>As a result of that natural efficiency, I believe that having a visual interface is going to continue to be useful for all sorts of things for a long time to come.</p><p>That‚Äôs <em>not</em> to say virtual assistants aren‚Äôt useful! Google Assistant on my Pixel is quite useful in part because it can show me answers and can tolerate vagueness in a way that an app with a fixed set of buttons never could.</p><p>But, as is so often the case with new useful tech, rarely does it complete replace everything that came before it, instead, it augments what we already have.</p><a name="if-apps-are-so-great-why-are-we-so-quotapped-outquot" class="anchor" href="#if-apps-are-so-great-why-are-we-so-quotapped-outquot"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>If apps are so great why are we so "apped out"?</h2></a><p>How do we explain that supposed efficiency when there‚Äôs data like this?</p><ul><li><a href="https://qz.com/253618/most-smartphone-users-download-zero-apps-per-month/">65% of smartphone users download zero apps per month</a></li><li><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/19/app-economy/">More than 75% of app downloads open an app once and never come back</a></li></ul><p>I think to answer that we have to really look at what isn‚Äôt working well.</p><a name="what-sucks-about-apps" class="anchor" href="#what-sucks-about-apps"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>What sucks about apps?</h2></a><ol><li><strong>Downloading them certainly sucks.</strong> No one wants to open an app store, search for the app they‚Äôre trying to find, then wait to download the huge file. These days a 50mb app is pretty small. Facebook for iOS 346MB, Twitter iOS 212MB.</li><li><strong>Updating them sucks.</strong> Every night I plug in my phone I download a whole slew of app updates that I, as a user, <strong>could not possibly care less about</strong>. In addition, many of these apps are things I installed <em>once</em> and will <strong>never open again, ever!</strong>. I‚Äôd love to know the global stats on how much bandwidth has been wasted on app updates for apps that were never opened again.</li><li><strong>Managing them sucks.</strong> Sure, when I first got an iPhone ages ago and could first download apps my home screen was impeccable. Then when we got folders!! Wow... what an amazing development! Now I could finally put all those pesky uninstallable Apple apps in a folder called "üí©" and pretend they didn‚Äôt exist. But now, my home screen is a bit of a disaster. Sitting there dragging apps around is not my idea of a good time. So eventually things get all cluttered up again.</li></ol><p>The thing I‚Äôve come to realize, is this:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>We don‚Äôt care how they got there. We only care that they‚Äôre <em>there</em> when we need them.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>For example, I love to go mountain biking and I enjoy tracking my rides with an app called Strava. I get all geared up for my ride, get on my bike and then go, "Oh right, gotta start Strava." So I pull out my phone <em>with my gloves on</em> and go: "Ok Google, open Strava".</p><p>I <em>could not care less</em> about where that app was or where it came from when I said that.</p><p>I don‚Äôt care if it was already installed, I don‚Äôt care if it never existed on my home screen, or if it was generated out of thin air on the spot.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Context is <em>everything</em>!</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>If I‚Äôm at a parking meter, I want the app <em>for that</em>. If I‚Äôm visiting Portland, I want their public transit app.</p><p>But I certainly <em>do not</em> want it as soon as I‚Äôve left.</p><p>If I‚Äôm at a conference, I might want a conference app to see the schedule, post questions to speakers, or whatnot. But wow, talk about something that quickly becomes worthless as soon as that conference is over!</p><p>As it turns out the more "ad hoc" these things are, the better! The more <em>disposable</em> and <em>re-inflatable</em> the better!</p><p>Which also reminds me of something that I feel like we often forget. We always assume people want our shiny apps and we measure things like "engagement" and "time spent in the app" when really, and there certainly are exceptions to this such as apps that are essentially entertainment, but often...</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>People don‚Äôt want to use your app. They want <em>to be done</em> using your app.</p></blockquote></blockquote><a name="enter-pwas" class="anchor" href="#enter-pwas"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Enter PWAs</h2></a><p>I‚Äôve been contracting with Starbucks for the past 18 months. They‚Äôve taken on the ambitious project of essentially re-building a lot of their web stuff in Node.js and React. One of the things I‚Äôve helped them with (and pushed hard for) was to build a PWA (Progressive Web App) that could provide similar functionality as their native apps. Coincidentally it was launched today: <a href="https://preview.starbucks.com">https://preview.starbucks.com</a>!</p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My team at <a href="https://twitter.com/Starbucks">@Starbucks</a> has been building a PWA, and it's now in beta!

But until PWAs came along, as hard as we tried, you couldn‚Äôt quite build a <em>real app</em> with just web tech. Honestly, I kinda hate myself for saying that, but in terms of something that a user would understand as an "app" I‚Äôm afraid that statement has probably true until very recently.</p><p>So what‚Äôs a PWA? As one of its primary contributors put it:</p><blockquote><p>It‚Äôs just a website that took all the right vitamins.</p><p>‚Äì Alex Russell</p></blockquote><p>It involves a few specific technologies, namely:</p><ul><li>Service Worker. Which enable true reliability on the web. What I mean by that is I can build an app that as long as you loaded it while you were online, from then on it will <em>always</em> open, even if you‚Äôre not. This puts it on equal footing with other apps.</li><li>HTTPS. Requires encrypted connections</li><li>Web App Manifest. A simple JSON file that describes your application. What icons to use is someone adds it to their home screen, what its name is, etc.</li></ul><p>There are plenty of other resources about PWAs on the web. The point for my purposes is:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>It is now possible to build PWAs that are <em>indistinguishable</em> from their native counter parts</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>They can be up and running in a fraction of the time whether or not they were already "installed" and unlike "apps" can be saved as an app on the device <em>at the user‚Äôs discretion!</em></p><p>Essentially they‚Äôre really great for creating "ad hoc" experiences that can be "cold started" on a whim nearly as fast as if it were already installed.</p><p>I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again:</p><blockquote><p>PWAs are the biggest thing to happen to the mobile web since the iPhone.</p><p>‚Äì Um... that was me</p></blockquote><a name="lets-talk-internet-of-things" class="anchor" href="#lets-talk-internet-of-things"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Let‚Äôs talk Internet of things</h2></a><p>I happen to think that PWAs + IoT = ‚ú® MAGIC ‚ú®. As several smart folks have pointed out.</p><p>The one-app-per-device approach to smart devices probably isn‚Äôt particularly smart.</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt scale well and it completely fails in terms of "ad hoc"-ness. Sure, if I have a Nest thermostat and Phillips Hue lightbulbs, it‚Äôs reasonable to have two apps installed. But even that sucks as soon as I want someone else to be able to use control them. If <em>I just let you into my house</em>, trust me... I‚Äôm perfectly happy to let you flip a light switch, you‚Äôre in my house, after all. But for the vast majority of these things there‚Äôs no concept of "nearby apps" and, it‚Äôs silly for my guest (or a house-sitter) to download an app they don‚Äôt actually want, just so I can let them control my lights.</p><p>The whole "nearby apps" thing has so many uses:</p><ul><li>thermostat</li><li>lights</li><li>locks</li><li>garage doors</li><li>parking meter</li><li>setting refrigerator temp</li><li>conference apps</li></ul><p>Today there are lots of new capabilities being added to the web to enable web apps to interact with physical devices in the real world. Things like WebUSB, WebBluetooth, WebNFC, and efforts like <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">Physical Web</a>. Even for things like Augmented (and Virtual) reality, the idea of the items we want to interact with having URLs makes so much sense and I can‚Äôt imagine a better, more flexible use of those URLs than for them to point to a PWA that lets you interact with that device!</p><a name="forward-looking-statements" class="anchor" href="#forward-looking-statements"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Forward looking statements...</h2></a><p>I‚Äôve been talking about all this in terms of investing. If you‚Äôve ever read any company statement that discusses the future you always see this line explaining that things that are about to be discussed contains "forward looking statements" that may or may not ultimately happen.</p><p>So, here are <em>my</em> forward looking statements.</p><a name="1-pwa-only-startups" class="anchor" href="#1-pwa-only-startups"><h3><span class="header-link"></span>1. PWA-only startups</h3></a><p>Given the cost (and challenge) of user-acquisition and the quality of app you can build with PWAs these days, I feel like this is inevitable. If you‚Äôre trying to get something off the ground, it just isn‚Äôt very efficient to spin up <em>three whole teams</em> to build for iOS, Android, and the Web.</p><a name="2-pwas-listed-in-app-stores" class="anchor" href="#2-pwas-listed-in-app-stores"><h3><span class="header-link"></span>2. PWAs listed in App Stores</h3></a><p>So, there‚Äôs a problem with "web only" which is that for the good part of a decade we‚Äôve been training users to look for apps in the app store for their given platform. So if you‚Äôre already a recognized brand, especially if you already have a native app that you‚Äôre trying to replace, it simply isn‚Äôt smart for you <em>not to exist</em> in the app stores.</p><p>So, some of this isn‚Äôt all that "forward looking" as it turns out <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/07/08/the-progress-of-web-apps/">Microsoft has already committed to listing PWAs in the Windows Store</a>, more than once!</p><p><strong>They haven‚Äôt even finished implementing Service Worker in Edge yet!</strong> But they‚Äôre already committing hard to PWAs. In addition to post linked above, one of their lead Developer Relations folks, Aaron Gustafson just <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/yes-that-web-project-should-be-a-pwa">wrote an article for A List Apart</a> telling everyone to build PWAs.</p><p>But if you think about it from their perspective, of course they should do that! As I said earlier they‚Äôve struggled to attract developer to build for their mobile phones. In fact, they‚Äôve at times <em>paid</em> companies to write apps for them simply to make sure apps exist so that users will be able to have apps they want when using a Windows Phone. Remember how I said developer time is a scarce resource and without apps, the platform is worthless? So <em>of course</em> they should add first class support for PWAs. If you build a PWA like a lot of folks are doing then TADA!!! üéâ You just made a Windows/Windows Phone app!</p><p>I‚Äôm of the opinion that the writing is on the wall for Google to do the same thing. It‚Äôs pure speculation, but it certainly seems like they are taking steps that suggest they may be planning on listing PWAs too. Namely that the Chrome folks recently shipped a feature referred to as "WebAPKs" for Chrome stable on Android (yep, everyone). In the past I‚Äôve <a href="https://joreteg.com/blog/installing-web-apps-for-real">explained in more detail</a> why I think this is a big deal. But a shorted version would be that before this change, sure you could save a PWA to your home screen... <em>But</em>, in reality it was actually a glorified bookmark. That‚Äôs what changes with WebAPKs. Instead, when you add a PWA to your home screen it generates and "side loads" an actual <code>.apk</code> file on the fly. This allows that PWA to enjoy some privileges that were simply impossible until the operating system recognized it as "an app." For example:</p><ul><li>You can now mute push notifications for a specific PWA without muting it for all of Chrome.</li><li>The PWA is listed in the "app tray" that shows all installed apps (previously it was just the home screen).</li><li>You can see power usage, and permissions granted to the PWA just like any other app.</li><li>The app developer can now update the icon for the app by publishing an update to the app manifest. Before, there was no way to updated the icon once it had been added.</li><li>And a slew of other similar benefits...</li></ul><p>If you‚Äôve ever installed an Android app from a source other than the Play Store (or carriers/OEMs store) you know that you have to flip a switch in settings to allow installs from "untrusted sources". So, how then, you might ask, can they generate and install an actual <code>.apk</code> file for a PWA without requiring that you change that setting? As it turns out the answer is quite simple: Use a trusted source!</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>As it turns out WebAPKs are managed through Google Play Services!</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I‚Äôm no rocket scientist, but based on their natural business alignment with the web, their promotion of PWAs, the lengths they‚Äôve gone to to grant PWAs equal status on the operating system as native apps, it only seems natural that they‚Äôd eventually <em>list them in the store</em>.</p><p>Additionally, if Google did start listing PWAs in the Play Store both them and Microsoft would be doing it <em>leaving Apple sticking out like a sore thumb and looking like the laggard</em>. Essentially, app developers would be able to target a <em>massive</em> number of users on a range of platforms with a single well-built PWA. But, just like developers grew to despise IE for not keeping up with the times and forcing them to jump through extra hoops to support it, the same thing would happen here. Apple does <em>not</em> want to be the next IE and I‚Äôve already seen many prominent developers suggesting they already are.</p><p>Which bring us to another forward-looking statement:</p><a name="3-pwas-on-ios" class="anchor" href="#3-pwas-on-ios"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>3.

It <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/">simply isn‚Äôt true</a> and increasingly we‚Äôre seeing a lot more compatibility efforts between browser vendors.</p><p>For example: check out the <a href="http://wpt.fyi">Web Platform Tests</a> which is essentially Continuous Integration for web features that are run against new releases of major browsers. Some folks will recall that when Apple first claimed they implemented IndexedDb in Safari, the version they shipped was essentially unusable because it had major shortcomings and bugs.</p><p>Now, with the WPTs, you can drill into these features (to quite some detail) and see whether a given browser passes or fails. No more claiming "we shipped!" but not actually shipping.</p><a name="what-about-feature-quotxquot-on-platform-quotyquot-that-we-need" class="anchor" href="#what-about-feature-quotxquot-on-platform-quotyquot-that-we-need"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>What about feature "x" on platform "y" that we need?</h2></a><p>It could well be that you have a need that isn‚Äôt yet covered by the web platform. In reality, that list is getting shorter and shorter, also... HAVE YOU ASKED?! Despite what it may feel like, browser vendors eagerly want to know what you‚Äôre trying to do that you can‚Äôt. If there are missing features, be loud, be nice, but from my experience it‚Äôs worth making your desires known.</p><p>Also, it doesn‚Äôt take much to wrap a web view and add hooks into the native OS that your JavaScript can call to do things that aren‚Äôt <em>quite</em> possible yet.</p><p>But that also brings me to another point, in terms of investing, as the world‚Äôs greatest hockey player said:</p><blockquote><p>Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.</p><p>‚Äì Wayne Gretzky</p></blockquote><p>Based on what I‚Äôve outlined thus far, it could be more risky to building an entire application for a whole other platform that you ultimately may not need than to at least exhaust your options seeing what you can do with the Web first.</p><p>So to line ‚Äôem up in terms of PWA support:</p><ul><li>Chrome: yup</li><li>Firefox: yup</li><li>Opera: yup</li><li>Samsung Internet (<a href="https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175">the 3rd largest browser surprise!</a>): yup</li><li>Microsoft: huge public commitment</li><li>Safari: at least implementing Service Worker</li></ul><a name="ask-them-add-your-feature" class="anchor" href="#ask-them-add-your-feature"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Ask them add your feature!</h2></a><p>Sure, it may not happen, it may take a long time but <em>at least</em> try. Remember, developers have a lot more influence over platforms than we typically realize. Make. your. voice. heard.</p><a name="side-note-about-react-nativeexpo" class="anchor" href="#side-note-about-react-nativeexpo"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>Side note about React-Native/Expo</h2></a><p>These projects are run by awesome people, the tech is incredibly impressive. If you‚Äôre Facebook and you‚Äôre trying to consolidate your development efforts, for the same basic reasons as why it makes sense for them to create their on <a href="http://hhvm.com/">VM for running PHP</a>. They have realities to deal with at a scale that most of us will never have to deal with. Personally, I‚Äôm not Facebook.</p><p>As a side note, I find it interesting that building native apps and having as many people do that as possible, plays nicely into their advertising competition with Google.</p><p>It just so happens that Google is well positioned to capitalize off of people using the Web. Inversely, I‚Äôm fairly certain Facebook wouldn‚Äôt mind that ad revenue <em>not</em> going Google. Facebook, seemingly would much rather <em>be</em> your web, that be part of the Web.</p><p>Anyway, all that aside, for me it‚Äôs also about investing well.</p><p>By building a native app you‚Äôre volunteering for a 30% app-store tax. Plus, like we covered earlier odds are that no one wants to go download your app. Also, though it seems incredibly unlikely, I feel compelled to point out that in terms of "openness" Apple‚Äôs App Store is very clearly <em>anything</em> but that. Apple could decide one day that they really don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs possible to essentially circumvent their normal update/review process when you use Expo. One day they could just decide to reject all React Native apps. I really don‚Äôt think they would because of the uproar it would cause. I‚Äôm simply pointing out that it‚Äôs <em>their</em> platform and they would have <em>every</em> right to do so.</p><a name="so-is-it-all-about-investing-for-your-own-gain" class="anchor" href="#so-is-it-all-about-investing-for-your-own-gain"><h2><span class="header-link"></span>So is it all about investing for your own gain?</h2></a><p>So far, I‚Äôve presented all this from kind of a cold, heartless investor perspective: getting the most for your time.</p><p>But, that‚Äôs not the whole story is it?</p><p>Life isn‚Äôt all about me. Life isn‚Äôt all about us.</p><p>I want to invest in platforms that increase opportunities <strong>for others</strong>. Personally, I really hope the next friggin‚Äô Mark Zuckerburg isn‚Äôt an ivy-league dude. Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if instead the next huge success was, I don‚Äôt know, perhaps a young woman in Nairobi or something? The thing is, if owning an iPhone is a prerequisite for building apps, it <em>dramatically</em> decreases the odds of something like that happening. I feel like the Web really is the closest thing we have to a level playing field.</p><p><strong>I want to invest in and improve <em>that</em> platform!</strong></p><p>This quote really struck me and has stayed with me when thinking about these things:</p><blockquote><p>If you‚Äôre the kind of person who tends to succeed in what you start,</p><p>changing what you start could be <em>the most extraordinary thing</em> you could do.</p><p>‚Äì Anand Giridharadas</p></blockquote><p>Thanks for your valuable attention ‚ù§Ô∏è. I‚Äôve presented the facts as I see them and I‚Äôve done my best not to "should on you."</p><p>Ultimately though, no matter how prepared we are or how much research we‚Äôve done; investing is always a bit of a gamble.</p><p>So I guess the only thing left to say is:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>I‚Äôm all in.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><em>Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a> for his super helpful feedback on this post.</em></p></section><footer><hr><h4>Thanks for reading, you may want to:</h4><ul><li><a href="https://reduxbook.com">read my new book Human Redux</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg">follow me on twitter</a></li><li><a href="http://consulting.joreteg.com">read about my consulting services</a></li><li><a href="/blog/all">see my other posts</a></li><li><a href="https://gumroad.com/henrikjoreteg/follow">get an email when I ship new stuff</a></li></ul></footer></article></main></div></div>
