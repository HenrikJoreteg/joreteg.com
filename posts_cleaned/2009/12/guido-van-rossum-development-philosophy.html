<blockquote>We have results when we have them&hellip;we don&rsquo;t set a date and then say we have to release this feature by a certain date and then suddenly the team has to pull several all-nighters and the quality of the feature is compromised. We don&rsquo;t like to work that way. It&rsquo;s too important to get things right.</blockquote>
