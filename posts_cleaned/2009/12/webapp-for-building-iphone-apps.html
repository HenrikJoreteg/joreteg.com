<p>Normally having a custom iPhone or Android app is something that is out of reach for smaller organizations. Also, as you may have heard the Apple&rsquo;s app approval process is quite a headache. Several of my friends and co-workers have written iPhone apps and the truth is, that it&rsquo;s a very real possibility that your app won&rsquo;t be accepted and all your work will have been wasted.</p>

<p>When I saw David Kaneda&rsquo;s amazing <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com">jQTouch</a> project, it made me realize that you could actually build &ldquo;navtive-feeling&rdquo; applications using nothing but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So I started playing with it.</p>

<p>But the beauty of the web, is that it&rsquo;s dynamic. That&rsquo;s when I had a bit of an epiphany: <strong>I realized that it&rsquo;s possible to build tools that will let people build their own custom iPhone app and completely circumvent the App Store</strong>. Check out this little demo that I built. It&rsquo;s still needs a bunch of styling and other work but I thought it was interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend watching the HD version just to see things more clearly.</p>
