<p>I just dumped my old blogging platform for the slick, sexy and completely customizable <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a>. I was sick of dealing with scum-of-the-earth spammers cluttering my site with comments linking to sites offering &ldquo;infinite bliss&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now with tumblr, I&rsquo;m in control, yet I don&rsquo;t have to worry about running my own wordpress or django app on a host somewhere. I can just use it to easily post whatever I want, from wherever I am (using the slick, free iPhone app).</p>

<p>Did I mention that I can write all my posts using John Gruber&rsquo;s amazing <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> syntax, automatically import whatever feeds I want and choose whether I wanna tweet my new posts to Twitter!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sold!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning on doing a lot more customizing&hellip; but so far, I&rsquo;m stoked! What you think?</p>
