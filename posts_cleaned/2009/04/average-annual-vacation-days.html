<p>It’s an interesting set of numbers and it says a lot about national values in the US. However, maybe our values need a second look:</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from the blog of Tim Ferris: <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/the-truth/#_usa_world">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/the-truth/#_usa_world</a></p>

<hr><p>Average Annual Vacation Days</p>

<table><tr><td>Italy</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Britain</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>13</td></tr></table><p>Is it any wonder that US Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks just about everything but worker satisfaction?</p>

<p>Americans work 137 more hours per year than Japanese workers, 260 more hours per year than British workers, and 499 more hours per year than French workers [22].</p>

<p>The Japanese document approximately 10,000 cases per year of “death by overwork,” or karoosh [23]. Considering the above stats, what must the undocumented US numbers be??</p>

<p>The US is the only nation in the industrialized world with no minimum paid-leave laws. European law provides each worker with 4-5 weeks per year of paid-leave.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Europe has had a higher productivity rate than the U.S. for 14 out of the 19 years between 1981 and 2000 [24]. More just isn’t better.</p>
