<p>Although I consider myself a political conservative the geek inside me is impressed the apparent tech-savvyness of President-Elect Barack Obama. This is one huge benefit of a relatively young president. I&rsquo;m excited to see signs that the Obama administration is using technology to interact with the populous.</p>

<p>Within days of being elected, Obama&rsquo;s team launched <a href="http://www.change.gov">http://www.change.gov</a> with a blog and updates about plans and ideas. The site includes something they call the <a href="http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/">Citizens Briefing Book</a> where anybody with an idea can contribute. Granted, mechanisms like this have existed before (remember snail mail?) but I&rsquo;ve gotta admit that it sure is nice to see a president who&rsquo;s not completely out-of-the-loop when it comes to technology.</p>

<p>As far as what will actually happen with all this talk of change, that is left to be seen.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
<a href="http://www.change.gov">Change.gov</a> has been shut down and the presidential website has undergone a makeover. Check it out at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">whitehouse.gov</a>.</p>
