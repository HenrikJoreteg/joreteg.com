<p>This is one of the coolest ideas I&rsquo;ve stumbled across for a while. Simple but ingenious:</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re called <a href="http://bloxes.com">Bloxes</a>. Imagine giant cardboard legos that achieve incredible strength due to their shape. You can use them as sound-dampening walls, office partitions, or anything you could think of. Then, disassemble them and rebuilt whatever you want. They were invented by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin">Jef Raskin</a> the guy who started the Macintosh project at Apple. Now they&rsquo;re being sold and marketed by his son <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/">Aza</a> who works for <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.</p>

<p>These thing are awesome! You can build all kinds of stuff, then tear it down as many times as you want. There&rsquo;s a whole <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bloxes/pool/">pool of pictures</a> on flickr showing various uses. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://bloxes.com">bloxes website</a> too.</p>

<p>I may just to get some of these to fortify/soundproof my office at work.</p>
