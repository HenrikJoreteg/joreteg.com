<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of Jeff Han or his company <a href="http://www.perceptivepixel.com/">Perceptive Pixel</a> you&rsquo;re out of the loop. Time magazine <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733754_1735325,00.html">named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world</a> in 2008. However, odds are you have no idea who he is or what he does.</p>

<p>How you interact with computers will change DRAMATICALLY during your lifetime. Think outside the mouse and keyboard for a second. Should your computer interface really consist of a finite number of buttons physically fixed in place.</p>

<p>In normal life, when you want something that&rsquo;s sitting on a desk you reach for it. You don&rsquo;t grab a mouse, maneuver a pointer to a specific location and click on it. We&rsquo;ve just worked with computers for so long that we&rsquo;ve forgotten how unnatural it really is. Technology innovators are increasingly &ldquo;putting the world&rdquo; into computer systems but we still interact with the virtual world in very unnatural ways.</p>

<p>That is exactly what Jeff Han and his company are fixing. They are reinventing how we interact with computers.</p>

<p>Average Joe has no interest in learning the intricacies of using a computer. There are so many different types of programs and systems out there, that the need to constantly learn different interfaces is a challenge. If interactions more closely matched our natural, tactile approach to the world, learning curves would be shorter and adoption rates would increase among those who are less technically inclined.</p>

<p>Just watch the video, it&rsquo;s very impressive. Enjoy.</p>
