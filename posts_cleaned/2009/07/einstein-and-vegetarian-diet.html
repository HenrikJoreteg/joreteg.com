<blockquote>Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.</blockquote>
<p>Albert Einstein</p>

<p>I find it interesting that this quote came from Einstein. I love steak, but there are some serious global issues caused by the human infatuation with eating meat. Everything from potential farmland to feed the locals being used for cattle shipped overseas to methane levels and unsanitary-hormone-pumped cow factories.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve considered going vegetarian for those reasons, but like many, I&rsquo;d have a really hard time knowing I&rsquo;d never eat another steak. I think, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s a bit creepy at first glance, there are huge potential benefits to lab grown flesh. Mark my words, that day is coming soon. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=lab+grown+meat">Google lab grown meat</a> if you&rsquo;re curious. Would you eat it though? I would.</p>
