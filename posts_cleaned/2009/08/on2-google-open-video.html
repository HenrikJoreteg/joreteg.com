<p>Google is buying On2 technologies. Why does this matter?</p>

<p>Open video. Period.</p>

<p>What do I mean? In 2004 the On2 VP6 codec was selected for use as the Flash 8 video codec. So many of the FLV files playing on the web today are compressed using On2&rsquo;s technology. Since then they&rsquo;ve also released another generation of codec called VP7 (they need better names). What you have to understand about these compression technologies from a technical standpoint is that they&rsquo;re freakin&rsquo; voodoo! From my own experience working with VP6 several years ago when I built <a href="http://www.houseflix.com">HouseFLIX.com</a>, I was completely dumbfounded at the minimal file sizes that could be produced. Our 3 minute video tours were rarely more than 12 or 13MB and the quality was still looked pretty decent in full-screen mode. I once connected it to a 63&quot; tv and blew it up to full size. It still looked good!</p>

<p>What is Google big mo these days? Open web. They want to make the web into a viable alternative platform to a traditional OS. Therefore, they&rsquo;re pushing non-proprietary web technologies forward in order to make web-based applications a more compelling alternative to their desktop counterparts. I would be very surprised if they didn&rsquo;t turn around and open source some of these technologies from On2 so that all of us eager HTML5 developers would have good codec options for use in our <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags. If the web is going to be ready to be a replacement for desktop applications by the time Google releases <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Chrome OS</a> next fall, some really good, non-proprietary video options are a necessity. I think On2&rsquo;s technology has the potential to make that happen.</p>
