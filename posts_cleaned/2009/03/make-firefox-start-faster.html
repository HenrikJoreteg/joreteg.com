<p>If you&rsquo;re more than just a casual web user and Firefox is your browser of choice&hellip; you may have noticed that it&rsquo;s gotten a bit sluggish at startup. This tip is for you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple trick: simply reduce the number of days of history you save in FF. It&rsquo;s <strong>90</strong> by default! If you&rsquo;re a web-nut, (like yours truly) that&rsquo;s a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of history. Put your history at something like 5 days and you should see a significant improvement in start-up times.</p>

<p>I read this on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">lifehacker</a>, and it worked like a charm for me&hellip; thought I&rsquo;d pass it on.</p>
