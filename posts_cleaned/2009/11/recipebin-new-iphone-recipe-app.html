<p>My wife was looking for a good way to organize her recipes, naturally I thought it would be cool to have it on the web, or her iPhone or something. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that I liked.</p>

<p>All the apps I saw were over-engineered and even simple tasks like adding a new recipe were unnecessarily complicated. So I figured I&rsquo;d build one in my spare time. I was looking for an excuse to learn how to use jQTouch anyways.</p>

<h3>Here were my main goals:</h3>

<ol><li>Web-based, but iPhone optimized. I wanted to easily be able to type in new recipes using a real keyboard on my computer and then view/edit them anywhere from the web or my iPhone.</li>
<li>I really wanted solid iPhone support for viewing recipes (preferably other high-end smartphones as well, like Palm Pre and Android). This is because I don&rsquo;t want to be forced to put my laptop on a messy kitchen counter with food everywhere.</li>
<li>Super easy, or non-existant sign-up process.</li>
<li>Delicious interface.</li>
</ol><h3>What I didn&rsquo;t care about:</h3>

<ol><li>IE support - this is a free app. I built it for me and IE doesn&rsquo;t support any of the fun CSS3 stuff, so frankly, I don&rsquo;t care if it looks terrible in IE. I don&rsquo;t wanna mess with it because I&rsquo;m not getting paid for this and supporting IE would be way too much work. It&rsquo;ll work in IE it&rsquo;ll just be ugly. If you&rsquo;re tech-savvy enough to have an iPhone, you have no business using something as old and lame as IE (switch to Chrome or FireFox).</li>
<li>Social features - I may add some of this stuff later, but for now I just want a good, simple bucket for storing my own stuff.</li>
<li>Complex functionality like unit conversions for measurements, etc. Doing this requires users to enter stuff in a more structured format which makes entering recipes harder than it needs to be. I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with it and realistically, that stuff appeals more to nerds than people like my wife who will actually use this.</li>
<li>Other, crazy complex features - just simple and usable, please.</li>
</ol><h3>What I used to build it:</h3>

<ol><li><a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> - The JavaScript library that take the headaches out of JavaScript.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jqtouch.com">jQTouch</a> - jQTouch makes it simple to build an webapp that feels like a native iPhone app. I have&rsquo;t tested it on Android or WebOS yet, but supposedly it will fully support these someday as well. Once I saw what you could do with jQTouch this decision was a no-brainer. Much props to <a href="http://twitter.com/davidkaneda">David Kaneda</a> for jQTouch.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> - Rock solid, feature-rich open source web application framework written in pure Python. It doesn&rsquo;t get any better than this.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a> - Fast scalable Python hosting environment that&rsquo;s free until you hit really high usage limits (roughly 5,000,000 page views per month). AppEngine supports Django 1.1 (not in it&rsquo;s entirety, but not too bad) and also makes authentication with Google Accounts <em>super</em> simple. Plus, if for some reason my App gets really popular I don&rsquo;t have to worry about scaling headaches or hardware issues because it runs on Google&rsquo;s architecture. There are definitely some limitations, but for a simple app like this, the benefits made it worth it. Plus, I wanted to learn how to do it and find out what limitations it had.</li>
<li>CSS3 + HTML5 - Even though these technologies aren&rsquo;t fully implemented in all browsers (*cough* IE *cough*) they make styling stuff fun again because you can do so much without needing javascript and loading a bunch of images. So far I didn&rsquo;t use too much from the up-and-coming HTML5 spec. But, I may use the client storage stuff to optimize speed on the iPhone down the road. For now, though it just uses some choice cuts of CSS3.</li>
</ol><h3>Features I&rsquo;d still consider adding:</h3>

<ol><li>Ability to share your entire library with other people. Say for example that I want to be able to access my wife&rsquo;s recipes without having to log in with her account and vise-versa. So, if you could specify who to share recipes with, that may be useful. </li>
<li>Ability to mark recipes as public.</li>
<li>Ability to select different templates for printing out recipes. If you wanted to use it to make a book or something.</li>
<li>A public API (possibly).</li>
</ol><p>This project is still definitely in development stages, but I thought I&rsquo;d put it out there now, just to get some feedback. If you want to check it out got to: <a href="http://www.RecipeBinApp.com">http://www.RecipeBinApp.com</a> from a modern browser or your iPhone, just sign in with your Google Account and start entering recipes. While it&rsquo;s possible to add and edit recipes on your phone, realistically, you&rsquo;ll want to do that in a regular browser. I highly recommend adding pictures of your recipes, because I built the web app portion with a highly visual display.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious to hear some feedback from anybody who wants to test it out. Feel free to sound off in the comments or just <a href="mailto:hjoreteg@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
