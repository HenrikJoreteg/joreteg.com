<p>Website owners everywhere bend over backwards, come up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_farm">crazy schemes</a> and try every trick in the book for increasing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Google Page Rank</a> of their site (and subsequently, traffic to their site).</p>

<p>This puts Google in a unique position of influence. Imagine if the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlebot">Googlebot</a> gave even just a hint of priority to sites that validated as XHTML Strict.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily advocating that, but imagine the impact on web developers! It would help bring standards compliance into the spotlight. Hopefully the resulting discussions would help move the web forward.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a web developer, rather than worry about reading up on web-standards, just install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/249">Html Validator</a> extension for Firefox and use it as you develop. It puts either a green check mark or a red X in the status bar of your browser as you browse. When there&rsquo;s a red X, simply click on it to see what errors the validator found. It&rsquo;s a powerful teaching tool and you&rsquo;ll soon find yourself obsessed with making sure each page of your site shows the green check mark.</p>

<p>(BTW, I&rsquo;m far from perfect in this area, but I&rsquo;m making the effort, and so should you)</p>
