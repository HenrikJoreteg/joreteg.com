<p>It’s official, next Monday (Aug 24, 2015) my five and a half year tenure at <a href="http://andyet.com/">&amp;yet</a> is over (Gulp!).</p>

<h2>What’s wrong? What happened?!</h2>

<p>Nothing. Seriously. It’s just been five and a half years and it feels like its time for new adventures.</p>

<p>Things are and will continue to be great at &amp;yet, with lots of interesting clients, lots of <a href="http://andyetconf.com/">cool stuff coming up</a> and I will always <em>highly</em> recommend them as a consulting company.</p>

<p>I’ve had an amazing time at &amp;yet and have very ambivalent feelings about quitting because I &lt;3 my teammates and we’ve had some <a href="https://blog.andyet.com/2011/03/03/devcastle">incredible</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-art-of-experience/arrival-d47000091355">experiences</a> together that are nothing short of priceless.</p>

<p>But sometimes you’ve gotta take a leap and follow your gut.</p>

<h2>So what’s next?</h2>

<p>In the short term, I’m available for independent consulting.</p>

<p>I’ve set up <a href="http://consulting.joreteg.com/">a simple page</a> explaining the types of projects I can help with as well as my rates and availability.</p>

<p>In short, I’m available to start a new project on September 14.</p>

<p>If you have a project you want to talk to me about, <a href="http://consulting.joreteg.com/">read that short consulting page</a> then shoot me an email: <a href="mailto:henrik@joreteg.com">henrik@joreteg.com</a>.</p>

<h2>What about the long term?</h2>

<p>If you know me, you know I’ve always got a few things in the hopper. For one, there’s this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I may have accidentally started writing another book.</p>

<p>— Henrik Joreteg (@HenrikJoreteg) <a href="https://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg/status/632802841694834689">August 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Additionally, this hints at another, still somewhat vague idea I’ve started working on:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The day will come when a major paid SaaS ships without writing or deploying their own backend.</p>— Henrik Joreteg (@HenrikJoreteg) <a href="https://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg/status/633099515361267713">August 17, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>More on all that in the future. Till next post… see ya on the interwebz. Questions? <a href="mailto:henrik@joreteg.com">Email me</a> or ping me, <a href="http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg">@HenrikJoreteg</a> on twitter.</p>
