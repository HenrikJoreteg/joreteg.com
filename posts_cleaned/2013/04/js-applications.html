<p>Crazy, random thought: Just think if you could serve a JS file with a content type of &ldquo;application/javascript&rdquo; and just have the browser treat it as the the equivalent of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;script src="/the_application.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That would certainly help clarify the distinction between a clientside app and a server side one.</p>
