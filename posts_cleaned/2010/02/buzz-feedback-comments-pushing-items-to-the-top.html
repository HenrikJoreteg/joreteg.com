<p>I just <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/request.py?contact_type=buzz">submitted feedback</a> to Google regarding Buzz. Here&rsquo;s what I said, if you agree, please do the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a fan of Buzz so far. One request though:</p>
  
  <p>If I follow a user with a lot of followers such as Seesmic founder Loic Lemur, they will inevitably get tons of comments on their posts. I don&rsquo;t want them at the top of my list just because anybody has commented on their post. I just end up seeing the same Buzz post over and over again at the top. That&rsquo;s too much noise and is not helpful.</p>
  
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think they should end up at the top of the list unless I&rsquo;m part of the comment stream. Until that changes it will be hard for Buzz to replace Twitter for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also included this screenshot. I really don&rsquo;t care about 62 people saying hi to Loic. No reason to put it at the top. Sorry Google, please change this!</p>
