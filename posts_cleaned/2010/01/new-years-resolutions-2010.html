<p>Definitely a bit late, but nonetheless, here&rsquo;s a few resolutions for 2010</p>

<ul><li>Get 100 churches signed up for my new <a href="http://BulletinApp.com">BulletinApp.com</a> service.</li>
<li>Make 50% of my household income from passive (or at least semi-passive) sources. </li>
<li>Do 100 pushups in a row.</li>
<li>Learn how to hold a hand-stand for more than 1 minute.</li>
<li>Take my home office as close to paperless as possible. (<a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> rocks!)</li>
<li>Buy a house.</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s a start&hellip; I may add to this list, but I&rsquo;m not gonna take anything off!</p>
