<p>Google just built a sweet mobile version of Google voice for iPhone.</p>

<p>I have but one complaint about all the awesome HTML5 mobile webapps that Google has been releasing lately.</p>

<p><em>They open in Safari on my iPhone</em></p>

<p>That means that each time I want to access it even if I save a shortcut to my homescreen on the iPhone it opens in a new window in Safari. This gets annoying in a hurry and actually stops me from using the other mobile web apps like Gmail from my phone (I use the built in mail program instead).</p>

<p>The silly thing is <em>this is sooooo easy to fix</em>!</p>

<p>All they would have to do is add the following meta tag to their mobile apps:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Problem solved, now if I saved it to my homescreen it would open as if it were a stand-alone application. Why Google, why?</p>

<p>There must be a reason, but it makes no sense to me.</p>
