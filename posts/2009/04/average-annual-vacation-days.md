<p>It’s an interesting set of numbers and it says a lot about national values in the US. However, maybe our values need a second look:</p>

<p>Americans work 137 more hours per year than Japanese workers, 260 more hours per year than British workers, and 499 more hours per year than French workers [22].</p>

<p>The Japanese document approximately 10,000 cases per year of “death by overwork,” or karoosh [23]. Considering the above stats, what must the undocumented US numbers be??</p>

<p>The US is the only nation in the industrialized world with no minimum paid-leave laws. European law provides each worker with 4-5 weeks per year of paid-leave.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Europe has had a higher productivity rate than the U.S. for 14 out of the 19 years between 1981 and 2000 [24]. More just isn’t better.</p>
