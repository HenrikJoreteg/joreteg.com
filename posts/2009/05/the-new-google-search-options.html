<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk recently about how <a href="http://search.twitter.com">twitter&rsquo;s search</a> will impact the search industry, mainly because of the &ldquo;real-time&rdquo;, &ldquo;as-it&rsquo;s-happening&rdquo; aspect of it that hasn&rsquo;t been available in Google.</p>

<p>Well, a couple days ago, Google released some search improvements of their own. Say hello to &ldquo;search options&rdquo;:</p>

<p>They introduce several new filtering options, most notably (IMO), the ability to filter by &ldquo;recency&rdquo;. I gave it a quick try by Googling my name and selecting &ldquo;Past 24 hours&rdquo;:</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too bad. It included one (of several) Twitter posts from last night, a comment on a Friend Feed post, and my friend <a href="http://www.joshhighland.com">Josh Highland&rsquo;s</a> blog post from yesterday, who has me in his blog roll.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing with time, the accuracy and completeness of these more recent results will improve. So far, though, it wasn&rsquo;t too bad. Finally, Google added a few other features that are probably more fun than useful like the &ldquo;Wonder Wheel&rdquo; option that displays a visuallization of related searches and lets you quickly switch from one to the other:</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m a fan and I plan on leaving this option turned on. Have you tried search options? What are your reactions?</p>
