<p>Google is buying On2 technologies. Why does this matter?</p>

<p>Open video. Period.</p>

<p>What do I mean? In 2004 the On2 VP6 codec was selected for use as the Flash 8 video codec. So many of the FLV files playing on the web today are compressed using On2&rsquo;s technology. Since then they&rsquo;ve also released another generation of codec called VP7 (they need better names). What you have to understand about these compression technologies from a technical standpoint is that they&rsquo;re freakin&rsquo; voodoo! From my own experience working with VP6 several years ago when I built <a href="http://www.houseflix.com">HouseFLIX.com</a>, I was completely dumbfounded at the minimal file sizes that could be produced. Our 3 minute video tours were rarely more than 12 or 13MB and the quality was still looked pretty decent in full-screen mode. I once connected it to a 63&quot; tv and blew it up to full size. It still looked good!</p>
