title: "Working in the business vs. on the business"
...

<blockquote>So many managers and businesses spend so much time completing tasks that they rarely stand back and ask, “Is this the most effective way to work on this task?” It is the age-old problem of spending too much time working <em>in</em> the business and forgetting to work <em>on</em> the business.</blockquote>
