<p>I recently had a discussion with <a href="http://twitter.com/johnderosa">@johnderosa</a> on Twitter about a good Pandora setup that doesn&rsquo;t require keeping a browser tab open all the time. So I thought I&rsquo;d whip up a quick explanation of my setup.</p>

<p>The key to all this is a free mac app called <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid</a>:</p>
