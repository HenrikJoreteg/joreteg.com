<p>When I&rsquo;m building out a new app I don&rsquo;t want to deal with setting up databases or repeatedly entering dummy data if I make changes to my models. Django fixtures and SQLite to the rescue!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I do it:</p>

<p>In my <code>settings.py</code> here are my relevant db settings:</p>

<pre><code># create site root variable
import os 
SITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
DATABASE_NAME = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'dev.db')
DATABASE_USER = ''
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when I define my <code>models.py</code> and then run <code>python manage.py syncdb</code>, Django will create all the tables for me based on my models and put the entire database in a single self-contained file called <code>dev.db</code> at the root of my project folder.</p>

<p>Then I can enter my test data in the amazing auto-generated django admin.</p>

<p>Now, to create my fixtures, all I have to do it run:</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py dumpdata --indent=4 &gt; my_app_name/fixtures/initial_data.json
</code></pre>

<p>(If your django app doesn&rsquo;t already have a &ldquo;fixtures&rdquo; directory, you&rsquo;ll have to create it first.)</p>

<p>This command will write all your data to a JSON file. The <code>--indent=4</code> flag is just so it&rsquo;s easier to read. But after running this command look in your fixtures folder you&rsquo;ll see a <code>initial_data.json</code> file that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    "model": "myapp.person",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Lennon"
    }
  },
  {
    "model": "myapp.person",
    "pk": 2,
    "fields": {
      "first_name": "Paul",
      "last_name": "McCartney"
    }
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker&hellip; now, if for some reason you need to delete your entire <code>dev.db</code> database, all you have to do is run <code>python manage.py syncdb</code>, and it will automatically re-inflate the database with all your test data! Pretty freakin&rsquo; sweet eh? (no I&rsquo;m not canadian).</p>

<p>Obviously, if you make changes to your models that the dummy data incorrect, this trick won&rsquo;t help you much. But it&rsquo;s perfect for the models that probably won&rsquo;t change so much during development.</p>

<p>So, thanks to Django you can now quickly whip up a prototype without having to build a database or worry about database drivers, AND you can even completely delete your database without losing all your test/dummy data. So sweet!</p>

<p>This one deserves the  #awesomecode tag IMHO.</p>
