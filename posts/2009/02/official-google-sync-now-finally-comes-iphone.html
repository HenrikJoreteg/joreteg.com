<p>Over on the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/calendar-and-contact-syncing-for-iphone.html">Official Google Blog</a> they just announced support for contact and calendar syncing with the iPhone!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been hoping for this since I first got my iPhone. You can read the <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html">full iPhone specific details here</a>. The cool thing it&rsquo;s using Microsoft Exchanges Active Sync feature, which means 1 thing. FREE PUSH FUNCTIONALITY!</p>

<p>But, be warned&hellip; it will wipe your contacts and calendars on your device. So, I&rsquo;m waiting till I get home to actually try this out. Supposedly it supports multiple calendars too!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing Apple will lose some MobileMe customer over this because frankly, the syncing ability is the only reason I signed up for MobileMe.</p>
