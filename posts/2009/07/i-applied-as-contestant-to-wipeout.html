<p>Yeah, so you know all those douchebags who fall on their faces on ABC&rsquo;s hit show &ldquo;Wipeout&rdquo;? That could be me! I&rsquo;ve never tried to apply for anything like this before, they had me fill out this whole long questionnaire about all kinds of stuff, such as specifying my skydiving skills on a scale of 1 to 7. It&rsquo;d be awesome if they picked me&hellip; probably won&rsquo;t happen, but I guess we&rsquo;ll see. Wish me luck!</p>
