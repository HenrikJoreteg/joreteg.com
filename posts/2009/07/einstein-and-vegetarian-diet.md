Albert Einstein

I find it interesting that this quote came from Einstein. I love steak,
but there are some serious global issues caused by the human infatuation
with eating meat. Everything from potential farmland to feed the locals
being used for cattle shipped overseas to methane levels and
unsanitary-hormone-pumped cow factories.

I’ve considered going vegetarian for those reasons, but like many, I’d
have a really hard time knowing I’d never eat another steak. I think,
despite the fact that it’s a bit creepy at first glance, there are huge
potential benefits to lab grown flesh. Mark my words, that day is coming
soon. [Google lab grown
meat](http://www.google.com/search?q=lab+grown+meat) if you’re curious.
Would you eat it though? I would.
