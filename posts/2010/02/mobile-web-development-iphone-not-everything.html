title: "PPK on iPhone and mobile web testing"
...

<blockquote><p>We web developers are doing an amazingly lousy job right now. We have to start serious mobile testing instead of just playing around with our iPhone for a few minutes before declaring our site fit for mobile.</p>

<p>Supporting all browsers is the whole f*ing point of being a good web developer, and Iâ€™m going to force you to do it even if I have to personally swear at each of you individually.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from an article on QuirksMode about how we developers are treating the iPhone web browser much like IE6 when it first came out. We can&rsquo;t treat it like it&rsquo;s the only compatibility check necessary. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m personally a bit guilty of. Let&rsquo;s not go down that road again, the web is open by nature. Let&rsquo;s not pigeonhole ourselves by overly emphasizing one browser.</p>
