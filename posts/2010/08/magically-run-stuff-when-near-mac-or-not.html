<h2>What you need</h2>

<ul><li>A Mac</li>
<li>Some type of bluetooth device you always have with you (let&rsquo;s get real, if you&rsquo;ve got a mac you&rsquo;re using an iPhone)</li>
</ul><h2>Step 1.</h2>

<p>Download and install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/reduxcomputing-proximity/downloads/list">Proximity</a>:</p>

<h2>Step 2.</h2>

<p>Open AppleScript editor and create a script to run when you&rsquo;re near your computer. Mine is super simple. It just turns off the screen saver and sets my chat status in &ldquo;Adium&rdquo; (if it&rsquo;s running) to available. But obviously you could do anything you can do in AppleScript. Mine looks something like this:</p>

<hr><pre><code>tell application "ScreenSaverEngine" to quit

if appIsRunning("Adium") then
    tell application "Adium" to go available
end if

on appIsRunning(appName)
    tell application "System Events" to (name of processes) contains appName
end appIsRunning
</code></pre>

<hr><p>And create another one for when you&rsquo;re away. Once again mine&rsquo;s super simple:</p>

<hr><pre><code>tell application "ScreenSaverEngine" to activate

if appIsRunning("Adium") then
    tell application "Adium" to go away with message "Appears to have stepped away for a bit."
end if

on appIsRunning(appName)
    tell application "System Events" to (name of processes) contains appName
end appIsRunning
</code></pre>

<hr><p>I saved these two scripts in a &ldquo;Scripts&rdquo; folder I created in my home directory (fancy that!).</p>

<h2>Step 3.</h2>

<p>Now all you have to do is give tell Proximity which script to run when and which bluetooth device you want it to look for. If Proximity is running you&rsquo;ll see a small (somewhat ugly) bluetooth lookin&rsquo; icon in your toolbar. Click it to open preferences. My preferences look like this:</p>

<h2>Step 4.</h2>

<p>Tell <a href="http://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg">@HenrikJoreteg</a> on twitter that it worked for you and that you&rsquo;d give him a high-five if you were within reasonable high-five range.</p>
