<p>With the advent of mass self-publishing on the web, what will be done with all that useless content that is created? There&rsquo;s a beautiful freedom of speech aspect of self-publishing, but to be quite honest, there&rsquo;s a lot of relatively worthless content on the web.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not a whole lot of content validation. I feel there are opportunities for entrepreneurs who can find ways to validate and qualify user-submitted information. Mozilla corporation, the makers of Firefox are a perfect example. Granted, they are not necessarily trying to make money. They say that they are motivated by the concept of an &lsquo;open web&rsquo;. But their model is unique in that the code and features of Firefox is all created by a huge network of programmers who are lending their talents to the cause. They have a system for qualifying and validating the content submitted and as a result they&rsquo;ve created one of the most popular browsers in the world.</p>

<p>Rather than simply proliferating content for content&rsquo;s sake, those who find ways to do quality control and provide clear, useful information will, in my opinion have a good shot at success.</p>
