<p>A trusted business adviser mentioned something interesting. So many people make life decisions out of fear. Fear of the unknown and fear of losing what they have (even if it&rsquo;s only mediocre). It would be interesting to see what would happen if people started making decisions based on what they want instead of simply avoiding what they don&rsquo;t want.</p>

<p>I heard a twist on this from Stanford&rsquo;s entrepreneurial thought leaders podcast series. A venture capitalist was quoted as saying, that the single strongest determinant of success in new businesses is not the quality of the idea. It&rsquo;s the faith, and persistence of the entrepreneur. In fact he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather fund an OK idea that the entrepreneur truly is sold on, than a great idea proposed with partial belief of the entrepreneur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reasoning was simple. Even great ideas will hit major road blocks and the persistence and belief of the entrepreneur is what determines how that road block is handled&hellip; and often the survival of the business.</p>

 from the masses. Making decisions based on what they want instead of fear is what gives them the strength and persistence necessary to push through the challenges.</p>
