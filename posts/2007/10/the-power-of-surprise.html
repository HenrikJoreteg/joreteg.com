<p>In his book &ldquo;The Starbucks Experience&rdquo; author Joseph A. Michelli talks about the power of the unexpected. It really hit me, because it&rsquo;s so blatantly obvious when you think about it.</p>

<p>As a business owner, making good on your promises is a good place to start. But, if you really want to set yourself apart, venture into the realm of the unexpected.</p>

<p>Popcorn, peanuts and molasses are not what made &ldquo;Cracker Jack&rdquo; a household name. It was the surprise!</p>

<p>You see, nobody tells their friends about getting ordinary service. Because IT&rsquo;S BORING! You tell your friends about the stuff that <em>blindsides</em> you. The crazier it was the more people are gonna hear about it. Those are the items that make up conversation.</p>

<p>Any brand conscious company wants word-of-mouth advertising because as consumers we are completely inundated with bogus, outrageous advertising claims. We need not look further than the junk mail we throw away every day. That&rsquo;s why a trusted friend&rsquo;s recommendation is more effective than a hundred TV ads.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the secret to a successful &ldquo;word-of-mouth campaign&rdquo; (if there even is such a thing)? It&rsquo;s not rocket science, you <strong>purposely and consistently do things that are both unexpected and positive</strong>.</p>

<p>The more outrageous, the better! You may have heard the story of the customer who successfully returned a car tire to Nordstroms, or they guy who took a hacksaw to his new Craftsman crescent wrench in the parking lot at Sears only to walk back in and exchange it for a brand new one without a word of complaint.</p>

<p>See, these stories were so extraordinary that I&rsquo;m sitting here writing about them <em>years</em> after they happened.</p>

<p>Surprise your customers and you&rsquo;ll give them something to talk about.</p>
