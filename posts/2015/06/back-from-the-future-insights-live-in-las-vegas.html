<p>I had a blast at <a href="https://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2015/">Future Insights Live</a> in Vegas this week where I led a 1-day workshop on Building a Modular Front-end Application and gave a talk about Optimizing for Change (by using modular architectures).</p>

<p>The event was a great mix of content and people, excellently curated and executed. Big props to <a href="https://twitter.com/bathcitygirl">Sarah Robinson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/followellie">Ellie Robinson</a> who produced the conference.</p>

<p>Happy to have gotten to hang out with a bunch of really great people, such as <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/">Jonathan Stark</a>, <a href="https://hitenism.com/">Hiten Shah</a> (founder of <a href="https://kissmetrics.com/">KissMetrics</a> and <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com">CrazyEgg</a>), and seeing some friends from previous conferences like <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjenson">Scott Jenson</a>.</p>

<p>Biggest takeaways:</p>

<ul><li>From Hiten&rsquo;s talk: Measure things, test things. So you can discover what actually works instead of blindly publishing things.</li>
<li>The Physical Web stuff that Scott is working on at Google is really awesome and is still going strong: <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">https://google.github.io/physical-web/</a></li>
<li>From Jonathan&rsquo;s keynote: </li>
</ul><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2 billion smart phones on the planet now. 
4 billion predicted by 2020 (80% of adults).
