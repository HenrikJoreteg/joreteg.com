<blockquote><p>I’ve known horrible programmers who were prolific. I’ve known great programmers who were slow but thorough.</p>

<p>In my experience the best developers are all curious, passionate people. They care about their craft and want to make something great. They’re always looking for ways to improve themselves and their code. It’s how they go from novice to expert – by constantly learning.</p></blockquote>
