<p>It&rsquo;s official, you no longer have any excuses for not tracking your money.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about using clunky (and costly) desktop software like Quicken and Microsoft Money. Plus, no one wants to type in or categorize all their transactions.</p>

<p>Say hello to a free, web-based alternative: <a href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mint.com/"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Rf-gIgFQFeA/SPavDOeM6lI/AAAAAAAAArs/PqPgj5YGAMY/s400/Mint_Screen_Shot.png" alt="Mint.com Screenshot"/></a>
Mint is a well-designed web app that automatically aggregates financial data from all your various online financial services. It imports, categorizes, and presents you with an up-to-the-minute snapshot of your finances.</p>

<p>It works for a wide range of institutions:</p>

<ol><li>Bank accounts</li>
<li>Investment/Retirement Accounts</li>
<li>Mortgages</li>
<li>Student Loans</li>
<li>Other loans</li>
</ol><p>It&rsquo;s so simple. Your entire financial life in one interface.</p>

<p>If you want detailed budgeting you may have to stick to a more traditional solution. However, if you take the cost of your time into consideration, I believe that Mint will give you the best return on investment.</p>

<p>I tested Mint when it was first released in September, 2007. At the time it was innovative, but lacked some of the features I wanted. Today, Mint has matured into a very useful tool with a much-improved interface.</p>

<p>Try it out, knowing where your money goes is the first step to getting your finances on track. You&rsquo;ve got nothing to lose.</p>
