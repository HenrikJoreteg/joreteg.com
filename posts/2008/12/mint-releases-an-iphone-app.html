<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://joreteg.com/post/98740551/minty-fresh-finances-tracking-your-money-with-mint">I wrote about Mint.com</a>.</p>

<p>Well, this amazing service just released an iPhone app. It&rsquo;s pretty basic, but it shows you everything you really need to know about your money while you&rsquo;re out and about.</p>

<p>Accessing the main Mint.com website through the Safari browser on the iPhone was a little wonky. I&rsquo;ve been hoping they&rsquo;d release an iPhone app ever since I first started using the site.</p>

<p>Well today is the day, Woohoo! If you haven&rsquo;t already, go <a href="http://www.mint.com">sign up</a> today.</p>
