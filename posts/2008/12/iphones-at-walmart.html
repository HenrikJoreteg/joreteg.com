<p>It&rsquo;s official, Apple is trying to go mainstream by selling iPhones at the world&rsquo;s largest retailer. That&rsquo;s right&hellip; Wal-Mart!</p>

<p>This is an interesting move for Apple. Typically, Apple products are sold with sleek, swanky merchandising in sleek, swanky Apple stores. Wal-Mart hardly fits that description. There was some speculation that if Apple made this move, they would sell a version of the iPhone for as little as $99. As it turns out, they&rsquo;re only reducing the price by a measly $2. Rather than $199 and $299, for the 8GB and 16GB models respectively, they&rsquo;ll be priced at $197 and $297. <em>LAME!</em> Why bother discounting them at all?</p>

<p>Regardless, the swanky Apple brand has just descended into the world of discount retailing.</p>

<p>Good move or straying too far from the sexy brand image they&rsquo;ve built? Guess we&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>
