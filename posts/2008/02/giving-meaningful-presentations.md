<p>Today will forever change how I approach giving a presentation.</p>

<p>This morning I had the most successful presentation of my life. It wasn&rsquo;t because it was a big audience or because I wowed them with my wit. It was a short, simple presentation about HouseFLIX to approximately 35 real estate agents at their office. No big deal. But, everybody followed along completely, they understood and connected with what I said, and Travis got a slew of new customers as a result.</p>

<p>I changed my normal presentation strategy in 2 ways. I hope I never forget them.</p>

<p>First, I stripped it down to the most simple message I could give and still be coherent. (My entire presentation took up 4 slides. There was 1 concept per slide.)</p>

<p>Second, was how I involved the audience, here&rsquo;s where I want to elaborate&hellip;</p>

<p>Presenting is about communication. It&rsquo;s not about what you say as the presenter, it&rsquo;s all about what the audience hears and understands.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to give a brilliant, eloquent and totally useless speech. People do it all the time. Those types of speeches may leave  audience impressed with the presenter&rsquo;s intelligence. But, unless the audience understood their message and can still remember it 2 weeks later. THEY FAILED.</p>

<p>Most presentations focus on facts. People simply go and rattle off a bunch of information and statistics. If presented well, it might be interesting at the time, but most people don&rsquo;t remember those stats 5 or 10 minutes later (Much less 5 or 10 days).</p>

<p>A better technique is to tell a story. Good stories create &ldquo;knowledge gaps&rdquo; where a few important pieces of information are missing and the audience stays focused to satisfy their curiosity. This improves recollection, but it&rsquo;s still not great.</p>

<p>The ultimate communication technique, even beyond story telling is when you can put your audience <em>in</em> the story. When you can get your audience to use their own imaginations to visualize a situation that you paint for them, it triggers all sorts of senses, emotions and responses in people&rsquo;s brains.
