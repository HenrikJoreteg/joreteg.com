<p>In the old days a business name wasn&rsquo;t considered so important. No overpaid creative geniuses were brought in to create a thrilling name like &ldquo;General Motors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, I assure you that since then, GM has paid big money to consulting firms to create names for their brands and vehicles.</p>

<p>A Chicago-based consulting company called NameLab does nothing but come up with product and company names (<a href="http://www.namelab.com">http://namelab.com</a>). A few of their more well known creations include: Olive Garden, Acura, CompUSA, LUXOR (LV casino), AutoZone.</p>

<p>So, what do they have to say about what makes a good name? They use all types of fancy language to describe their naming strategy. After sorting through it and adding a few thoughts of my own here are my &ldquo;take-home&rdquo; points:</p>

<ol><li><p>Names derive much of their meaning from experiences with similar products or services. For example, if is started a website called schmoogle, you would doubtlessly  begin forming associations with the search giant. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll want to ensure that similar sounding names/brands carry positive connotations. You&rsquo;ll also want to be careful with associating too closely with another brand, if they ruin their reputation, it could drag your brand down with it. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend naming an accounting firm anything that starts with &ldquo;EN&rdquo; or ends in &ldquo;RON&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike advertising that describes attributes or adjectives of the product, the product name is much more definitive. The name is the &ldquo;subject&rdquo; of the sentence. It doesn&rsquo;t just tell us what the product <em>does</em>, it tells us what it <em>is</em>. Therefore, don&rsquo;t pick a name that &ldquo;describes&rdquo; your product or company. Instead, let your name be something that can stand on it&rsquo;s own merit. Be inventive, create a brand new word.</p></li>
<li><p>Function matters. NameLab analyzes a name for its &ldquo;speech stream visibility&rdquo;, which is the probability that a word will be recognized in a normal spoken stream of English speech. Think &ldquo;iPod&rdquo; or &ldquo;Google&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo; These names all contain distinctive sounds that make them POP in a normal conversation. The same is true for &ldquo;Notational Visibility&rdquo;, which is the probability that a word will stand out from a typed text, such as a newspaper column. Again, think about the naming convention Apple has used in putting a small letter &ldquo;i&rdquo; in front of all their product names. They don&rsquo;t follow conventional capitalization rules. There&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s written as iPod instead of Ipod. &ldquo;iPod&rdquo; is far more unusual, hence it&rsquo;s more noticeable and memorable.</p></li>
