<p>Starting a business is tough. Many businesses can take 5 years to really get their footing. If you&rsquo;re going to commit several years of your life to building a business, you want to be sure that what you have is viable. Truth is, even if you have a viable model, there are going to be times when you won&rsquo;t believe that it is.</p>

<p>I learned a huge lesson this last week.</p>

<p>GET A MENTOR!</p>

<p>They say the number one reason businesses fail is undercapitalization. I disagree. If entrepreneurs sought qualified advice, they would know that they need more money to pull it off. The real reason for failure is that they think they don&rsquo;t need advice!</p>

<p>This week I contacted an acquaintance whom I didn&rsquo;t know so well. He goes to my church and he&rsquo;s friends with my wife&rsquo;s dad. I&rsquo;ve spoken to him a few times and he knew that I was working on some &ldquo;business related to real estate.&rdquo; All I knew about him was that he started a medical equipment business many years ago that has been very successful.</p>

<p>I wrote him an email. I expressed my frustration with the lack of qualified advice and just asked him if he&rsquo;d be willing to sit down with me for a few minutes. I wanted to hear about his experiences with getting his business going and get some feedback on what I was doing with mine.</p>

<p><strong>It was one of the most encouraging meetings of my life</strong>. He has been where I am. He worked hard and diligently on what seemed to be a worthwhile venture (like I&rsquo;m doing), and he&rsquo;s now a very successful man with a 20-employee business. In our meeting he did a lot of listening and offered some great insights. He could also relate to the personal and family challenges that come along with making a commitment to starting a business.</p>

<p>We decided to stay in touch and we&rsquo;ve been emailing since.</p>

<p>My only regret is that I didn&rsquo;t contact him sooner!</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are by definition &ldquo;do-it-your-selfers.&rdquo; However, I&rsquo;m realizing, that this stubborn &ldquo;I can do it all myself&rdquo; attitude is often a hindrance to their own success.</p>

<p>Take the time to seek well-qualified advice. If you ask humbly and graciously many people who have been through it will be happy to help. It&rsquo;s well worth the effort.</p>
