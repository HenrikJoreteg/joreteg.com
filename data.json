Sure, some cells may contain simple values, but others actually contain *formulas*. \n\nThe formula may, for example, describe that the cell should contain the sum of cells `A2` and `B2`. But, when you’re viewing it you’ll see the computed value, not the formula itself.\n\nThe real power of a spreadsheet comes from the fact that when you reference another cell from one formula the referenced cell could either contain a simple value *or another formula*. Any changes made to the inputs will flow through the entire spreadsheet. Each cell gets recomputed anytime any of its inputs change until the entire sheet is reflecting the changes that have cascaded through those formulas.\n\nWhat I’ve been describing with the spreadsheet is in fact **reactive programming**. Each cell is simply reacting to changes in the inputs.\n\nThat’s the key distinction: instead of writing code that calculates simple values, *we write code that describes relationships between sources of values*. \n\nOnce we’ve described how everything should react to the changes to its inputs, then the data flows through our functions until all the new values have been computed.\n\n## So, why would we want to build things that way? What does it gain us? \n\nWell, let’s think of the alternative:\n\nIf you have a table of values that you want to total up, you could certainly pull out a calculator, add them all up, and type the resulting value into the “Total” cell. \n\nDone! Easy.\n\nBut, now what happens when the values change? Obviously, you’d have to repeat the exercise. This may be tolerable for a small table, but it would quickly become completely unmanageable if you’re dealing with, say, an amortization table showing 30 years of monthly principal and interest payments. Managing changing inputs in that type of system requires a difference paradigm.\n\n## Let’s give a more specific example. \n\nLet’s say you want to build a mobile web app that is going to let people sort a list by touching and holding an item or swipe an item right and left to perform different actions on it.\n\nA browser gives us four different “touch” events we can listen for: \n\n1. `touchstart`\n2. `touchmove`\n3. `touched`\n4. `touchcancel`\n\nWhere’s my `touchhold` event?! There’s no such thing. So if we want to build an app that triggers “sort mode” when a user has held their finger on an item for a half second. Think about what we’d have to do:\n\n1. Listen for a `touchstart`\n2. start a timer\n3. wait half a second\n\nDoesn’t sound too bad right? But wait… we also have to make sure they haven’t moved their finger too far, but we should probably still consider it a hold if they’ve moved just a few pixels. We also have to make sure we stop the timer if we get a `touchend`.\n\nSo, now we have to also store starting position we have to compare that position with any subsequent `touchmove` events we have to continually calculate a distance moved from that starting point with any changes. As long as that distance is within our tolerance and the timer reaches half second before any `touchend` event… congrats, we have a “hold”. \n\nIf we think about it, this is really spreadsheet-type problem, right?\n\nWe’ve got some input cells that are simple values, some of which will be updated over time:\n\n1. starting X\n2. starting Y \n3. start time\n3. current X \n4. current Y\n5. current time\n\nWe’ve got formula cells that will calculate as the time passes and inputs change:\n\n1. time elapsed\n2. distance moved\n\nWe’ve got an `is holding` formula cell that uses the values from `time elapsed` and `distance moved`.\n\nUltimately, all this touch-related logic could be broken out into its own library. Then, our program would only have to care about that `is holding` cell and update the interface accordingly. All the complexity of how those touches are tracked and measured would be contained within the library.\n\nThis is just one example of types of issues reactive programming approaches help us deal with.\n\nOver time, you’ll find that much of the code we write is really just tracking and updating relationships between different variables. \n\nRecognizing that and learning to use reactive patterns allows us to more easily solve complex problems and break them down into small, manageable pieces. \n\nThen, just let the data flow.\n\n---\n*Note: I was asked to produce a writing sample explaining reactive programming for a technical writing contract. I'm posting it here because I thought it may be useful to someone (and yes, I \"passed\").*\n\nIf you like this, or if you think I botched it, please let me know on twitter: [@HenrikJoreteg](http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg)","outputFile":"/blog/reactive-programming.html","html":"<p>The term “reactive programming” may sound a bit cryptic, but if you’ve ever used a spreadsheet, you’re already quite familiar with the concept.</p><p>When you’re simply <em>viewing</em> a spreadsheet, each cell isn’t necessarily showing you what was actually typed into the cell.

That got me curious, because according to them it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to use the HTML 5 doctype which is gloriously simplified compared to other doctypes:</p>\n\n<p>HTML 5 looks like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(X)HTML 1.0 Strict looks like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &ldquo;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&rdquo;\n  &ldquo;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&rdquo;&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly, the HTML 5 version is actually memorizable (not a word&hellip; but should be), where any other doctype I&rsquo;ve ever seen nearly brought tears to my eyes. So I&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of digging and reading and learned something very interesting:</p>\n\n<p>Tons and tons of web-developers, write XHTML compliant sites, but they still serve it using text/html mime-types which means, the browser treats it like plain &lsquo;ol html anyways!</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the crux of the matter as described by <a href=\"http://webkit.org/blog/68/understanding-html-xml-and-xhtml/\">Maciej Stachowiak on the web-kit blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So what really determines if a document is HTML or XHTML? The one and only thing that controls whether a document is HTML or XHTML is the MIME type. If the document is served with a text/html MIME type, it is treated as HTML. If it is served as application/xhtml+xml or text/xml, it gets treated as XHTML. In particular, none of the following things will cause your document to be treated as XHTML:</p>\n  \n  <ul><li>Using an XHTML doctype declaration</li>\n  <li>Putting an XML declaration at the top</li>\n  <li>Using XHTML-specific syntax like self-closing tags</li>\n  <li>Validating it as XHTML</li>\n  </ul><p>In fact, the vast majority of supposedly XHTML documents on the internet are served as text/html. Which means they are not XHTML at all, but actually invalid HTML that’s getting by on the error handling of HTML parsers.

So I&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of digging and reading and learned something very interesting:</p><p>Tons and tons of web-developers, write XHTML compliant sites, but they still serve it using text/html mime-types which means, the browser treats it like plain &lsquo;ol html anyways!</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the crux of the matter as described by <a href=\"http://webkit.org/blog/68/understanding-html-xml-and-xhtml/\">Maciej Stachowiak on the web-kit blog</a>:</p><blockquote><p>So what really determines if a document is HTML or XHTML? The one and only thing that controls whether a document is HTML or XHTML is the MIME type. If the document is served with a text/html MIME type, it is treated as HTML. If it is served as application/xhtml+xml or text/xml, it gets treated as XHTML. In particular, none of the following things will cause your document to be treated as XHTML:</p><ul><li>Using an XHTML doctype declaration</li><li>Putting an XML declaration at the top</li><li>Using XHTML-specific syntax like self-closing tags</li><li>Validating it as XHTML</li></ul><p>In fact, the vast majority of supposedly XHTML documents on the internet are served as text/html. Which means they are not XHTML at all, but actually invalid HTML that’s getting by on the error handling of HTML parsers. All those “Valid XHTML 1.0!” links on the web are really saying “Invalid HTML 4.01!”.</p></blockquote><p>So who cares?!? What should we do?

We were excited, everything seemed great, it&rsquo;s a buyer&rsquo;s market so we were offered great incentives by the builder.</p>\n\n<p>But, something just wasn&rsquo;t right when we were negotiating. The sales rep Jim (James Zures)  was really insistent about us using their lender. I understand that it&rsquo;s far more convenient for them if we do. They&rsquo;re familiar with their lender&rsquo;s practices and they have had good experiences with them being able to close the deals on time. Also, if they have several homes being sold at the same time, it&rsquo;s far more convenient for them to get status updates from one lender instead of several different ones.</p>\n\n<p>They repeatedly told us that they have no financial relationship with the lender (because if they did that&rsquo;s illegal). Yet, they funny thing is that they were only willing to cover closing costs if we used their lender. In this case, they were going to cover up to the legal maximum of 6% or $12,000. If we didn&rsquo;t use their lender, we&rsquo;d get nothing. Obviously, that&rsquo;s a HUGE incentive. So, they were telling us, we have the option&hellip; but in reality you&rsquo;re way better off if you use our lender.</p>\n\n<p>To me, that&rsquo;s starting to sound a lot like a financial relationship. Sure, they&rsquo;re not paying the lender directly but they sure are steering business toward them with a heavy hand. Essentially, they are paying them through the customer. It&rsquo;s the builder&rsquo;s money, going into escrow (in our name) and then being directly applied to cover the loan fees. Now, this makes you wonder <strong>if there&rsquo;s no financial relationship, why would they care so much which lender we choose?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It gets more interesting, they wanted us to sign the purchase contract yesterday but we were not supposed to close on the house until the end of June because it wasn&rsquo;t built yet. But, we wouldn&rsquo;t get final loan terms until sometime at the end of May. That means, that as soon as we sign the purchase contract, our only options would be to use their lender and pay whatever rates and fees that they decide to charge, forfeit $12,000 in closing costs by using our lender, or forfeit our $5000 deposit! <strong>Not much of a choice if you ask me</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I told them over and over again: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind using your lender&hellip; I just want the option to go with another lender if I&rsquo;m not happy with the terms I&rsquo;m given.&rdquo; But, the more I said that, the more it sounded like it wasn&rsquo;t even an option.</p>\n\n<p>Because I believe in doing due diligence, I told Jim that I wanted to read over the contract. He was going to call his manager and check on something anyway so went out of his office for a while and brought the contract to look it over. I found the section about &ldquo;Choice of Lender.&rdquo; Turns out, the contract states that we can use our own lender. There were a few little hoops we had to jump through and a couple of forms to submit, but they legally have to give us the choice of using our own lender. When we went back to talk to Jim I pointed that out to him. He got all weird on us and then he was going to talk to his manager again.</p>\n\n<p>GET THIS. We come back in and now he&rsquo;s saying that the list price has jumped from $212,990 to about $340,000 and the only reason he quoted us $212,990 is because it supposedly included a $128,000 incentive for us to use their lender!!!! So now we went from a $12,000 incentive to over $120,000 incentive for using their lender. <strong>It became clear that we really did not have the choice of using our own lender.</strong> Ostensibly, we did, in reality they were not about to let us have that choice.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at Jim and said&hellip; &ldquo;What?!?! Now you&rsquo;re telling me the house price is $340,000 unless we use your lender?!?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Jim: &ldquo;yes, we just hadn&rsquo;t gotten to that part yet. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going over the contract so we can answer all your questions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Me: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that if I walked in here with cash, you would tell me the house price was $340,000?!?!

Call your manager, whatever you need to do, but that&rsquo;s not happening!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Then Holly and I left to get some lunch and talk it over. We couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened. They were dead set on us using their lender and now they were saying that the price was $100,000 more if we didn&rsquo;t. <strong>WHAT A JOKE!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>After talking for a bit, Holly and I decided that since we no longer trusted them, we were even more set on making sure we had the option.

We feel like we dodged a bullet. Imagine being committed to buying the house without knowing what the loan terms are going to be. At that point, what&rsquo;s stopping them from adding fees, giving you a higher interest rate or making up bogus fees before closing. They know you&rsquo;re stuck. The only way out is to lose your deposit. Ridiculous! We saw the price jump from $212,990 to well over $300,000 as soon as they realized we may not use their lender.

Every time he mentioned the price he should have included that disclaimer but&hellip; <em>it never even came up</em> until we were nearly ready to sign the contract!</p><p>Now I&rsquo;m really upset, I will be filing a complaint. James David Zures license number: 00609535 and MBK Southern California Residential Inc license number: 01304983 will soon have complaints on their records with the department of real estate.</p>","preview":"<p>This weekend my wife and I were getting ready to buy a beautiful new home in the Medallion neighborhood from MBK homes in Beaumont, CA. We were excited, everything seemed great, it&rsquo;s a buyer&rsquo;s market so we were offered great incentives by the builder.</p><p>But, something just wasn&rsquo;t right when we were negotiating. The sales rep Jim (James Zures) was really insistent about us using their lender. I understand that it&rsquo;s far more convenient for them if we do. They&rsquo;re familiar with their lender&rsquo;s practices and they have had good experiences with them being able to close the deals on time. Also, if they have several homes being sold at the same time, it&rsquo;s far more convenient for them to get status updates from one lender instead of several different ones.</p>"},{"slug":"using-form-labels-as-input-values-jquery","type":"text","date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Using Form Labels as Input Values with jQuery","old_url":"http://joreteg.com/post/98750890/using-form-labels-as-input-values-jquery","url":"/blog/using-form-labels-as-input-values-jquery","startingFilename":"/Users/henrik/Sites/joreteg.com/posts/2009/03/using-form-labels-as-input-values-jquery.html","markdown":"<p>I recently modified the comment forms on this site.

Until you&rsquo;re free from your unproductive debts, you&rsquo;re not free.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing sucks the life out of you like unproductive debt. As will be discussed in other posts, not all debt is bad. However, odds are pretty good that most personal debts that you have are tying you down, limiting your options, exposing you to too much risk and eating up your paycheck. A good rule of thumb is: Unless the loan helped you buy something that is making you money or you can safely earn a better interest rate than what you&rsquo;re paying, you should never have gotten that loan and you should pay it off A.S.A.P.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best things you can do for yourself is to start getting rid of those bad debts.</p>\n\n<p>To do that successfully, you need a strategy. Many people just try to randomly throw any extra money they can at all the various loans that they have. That approach is tiring, overwhelming and makes it hard to see progress. And frankly, without progress, people give up and stay trapped in debt.</p>\n\n<p>There is a <em>best</em> way to do this. Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example:</p>\n\n<p>Assume you have the following 5 loans:</p>\n\n<p>Car Loan 6% $15,000\nMasterCard at 10% with $4,000\nStudent Loan at 4.75% $43,000\nVisa Card at 19% interest with a balance of $2,000\nA Loan from BestBuy at 7% for $3,500 (you bought a big plasma TV you couldn&rsquo;t afford.)</p>\n\n<p>Where do you start?</p>\n\n<p>You only have so much each month to put toward your loans. So, the trick is to make it go as far as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Order them by Interest Rate</strong>\nList all your loans starting with the highest interest to the lowest. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the balance is $20,000 or $50. Put them in order of interest rate.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing with our example our list would be rearranged as follows:</p>\n\n<p>19% Visa Card \n10% MasterCard\n7% BestBuy loan\n6% Car Loan\n4.75% Student Loan</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Work out your budget </strong>\nFigure out just how much of your earnings you can put toward your loans each month. For our example let&rsquo;s say you have $2000 each month to put toward your loans.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best ways to ensure that you have enough money to pay your loans is to make the payments right away when you get your paycheck. This way you spend what&rsquo;s left instead of what&rsquo;s using what&rsquo;s left to pay back your loans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Target your first loan</strong>\nNow, pay minimum payments on every loan except for the first one on your list. Do NOT pay any more than minimum payments on any of your other loans. All your extra payments should be put exclusively toward the loan with the highest interest rate. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re paying more interest than you need to.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that interest rate is the only thing that matters here. No matter what the balance is on your other loans, only pay minimums on your other loans. But go crazy on your first one. Get that sucker paid off!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Knock-em down </strong>\nHere is where you&rsquo;ve got to stay strong. Once your first loan is paid off, now you may feel like some of the pressure is off and you can relax a bit more. That will screw up your plan.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, you&rsquo;ve already proven to yourself that you CAN put a certain amount of money each month toward your loans. So don&rsquo;t stop doing now, this is where you can really start seeing fast progress!</p>\n\n<p>Now you simply add the entire amount you were putting toward the first loan to the minimum payment on the second loan on your list. Continue this pattern way until you&rsquo;re out of debt. This will ensure that you pay the minimum amount of interest necessary and get out of debt as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A few more thoughts</strong>\nAs you start paying off your first couple of loans you&rsquo;ll get to the point where you&rsquo;re putting a LOT more than the minimum payment toward the loan that is now at the top of your list. It may be tempting to spend some of that money. But, paying more than minimum payments is the only way to make significant progress. In fact, in some cases, like high-interest credit cards, you won&rsquo;t EVER pay it off with minimum payments. Some loans are designed to keep you in debt forever. When you&rsquo;re making big payments you&rsquo;ll see progress and you&rsquo;ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you&rsquo;re paying the least amount of interest possible.</p>\n\n<p>Now&rsquo;s the time to start getting out of bad debt and stop buying stuff on credit. If you can&rsquo;t pay it by the end of the month and it isn&rsquo;t going to help you make more money, you have no business buying it! Be less stupid next time, live below your means. It&rsquo;ll change your life.</p>","outputFile":"/blog/action-plan-get-out-of-debt.html","html":"<p>Slavery may have been abolished with the 13th amendment, but millions of Americans are slaves to their debts.

Put them in order of interest rate.</p><p>Continuing with our example our list would be rearranged as follows:</p><p>19% Visa Card 10% MasterCard 7% BestBuy loan 6% Car Loan 4.75% Student Loan</p><p><strong>Step 2: Work out your budget</strong> Figure out just how much of your earnings you can put toward your loans each month. For our example let&rsquo;s say you have $2000 each month to put toward your loans.</p><p>One of the best ways to ensure that you have enough money to pay your loans is to make the payments right away when you get your paycheck. This way you spend what&rsquo;s left instead of what&rsquo;s using what&rsquo;s left to pay back your loans.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Target your first loan</strong> Now, pay minimum payments on every loan except for the first one on your list. Do NOT pay any more than minimum payments on any of your other loans. All your extra payments should be put exclusively toward the loan with the highest interest rate. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re paying more interest than you need to.</p><p>Notice that interest rate is the only thing that matters here. No matter what the balance is on your other loans, only pay minimums on your other loans. But go crazy on your first one. Get that sucker paid off!</p><p><strong>Step 4: Knock-em down</strong> Here is where you&rsquo;ve got to stay strong. Once your first loan is paid off, now you may feel like some of the pressure is off and you can relax a bit more. That will screw up your plan.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, you&rsquo;ve already proven to yourself that you CAN put a certain amount of money each month toward your loans. So don&rsquo;t stop doing now, this is where you can really start seeing fast progress!</p><p>Now you simply add the entire amount you were putting toward the first loan to the minimum payment on the second loan on your list. Continue this pattern way until you&rsquo;re out of debt. This will ensure that you pay the minimum amount of interest necessary and get out of debt as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong>A few more thoughts</strong> As you start paying off your first couple of loans you&rsquo;ll get to the point where you&rsquo;re putting a LOT more than the minimum payment toward the loan that is now at the top of your list. It may be tempting to spend some of that money. But, paying more than minimum payments is the only way to make significant progress. In fact, in some cases, like high-interest credit cards, you won&rsquo;t EVER pay it off with minimum payments. Some loans are designed to keep you in debt forever. When you&rsquo;re making big payments you&rsquo;ll see progress and you&rsquo;ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you&rsquo;re paying the least amount of interest possible.</p><p>Now&rsquo;s the time to start getting out of bad debt and stop buying stuff on credit. If you can&rsquo;t pay it by the end of the month and it isn&rsquo;t going to help you make more money, you have no business buying it! Be less stupid next time, live below your means. It&rsquo;ll change your life.</p>","preview":"<p>Slavery may have been abolished with the 13th amendment, but millions of Americans are slaves to their debts. The crazy part is that they signed up for it themselves! Until you&rsquo;re free from your unproductive debts, you&rsquo;re not free.</p><p>Nothing sucks the life out of you like unproductive debt. As will be discussed in other posts, not all debt is bad. However, odds are pretty good that most personal debts that you have are tying you down, limiting your options, exposing you to too much risk and eating up your paycheck. A good rule of thumb is: Unless the loan helped you buy something that is making you money or you can safely earn a better interest rate than what you&rsquo;re paying, you should never have gotten that loan and you should pay it off A.S.A.P.</p>"},{"slug":"minty-fresh-finances-tracking-your-money-with-mint","type":"text","date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","title":"Minty Fresh Finances, tracking your money with Mint.com","old_url":"http://joreteg.com/post/98740551/minty-fresh-finances-tracking-your-money-with-mint","url":"/blog/minty-fresh-finances-tracking-your-money-with-mint","startingFilename":"/Users/henrik/Sites/joreteg.com/posts/2008/10/minty-fresh-finances-tracking-your-money-with-mint.html","markdown":"<p>It&rsquo;s official, you no longer have any excuses for not tracking your money.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about using clunky (and costly) desktop software like Quicken and Microsoft Money.

It wasn&rsquo;t because it was a big audience or because I wowed them with my wit. It was a short, simple presentation about HouseFLIX to approximately 35 real estate agents at their office. No big deal. But, everybody followed along completely, they understood and connected with what I said, and Travis got a slew of new customers as a result.</p>\n\n<p>I changed my normal presentation strategy in 2 ways. I hope I never forget them.</p>\n\n<p>First, I stripped it down to the most simple message I could give and still be coherent. (My entire presentation took up 4 slides. There was 1 concept per slide.)</p>\n\n<p>Second, was how I involved the audience, here&rsquo;s where I want to elaborate&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Presenting is about communication. It&rsquo;s not about what you say as the presenter, it&rsquo;s all about what the audience hears and understands.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to give a brilliant, eloquent and totally useless speech. People do it all the time. Those types of speeches may leave  audience impressed with the presenter&rsquo;s intelligence. But, unless the audience understood his message and can still remember it 2 weeks later. HE FAILED.</p>\n\n<p>Most presentations focus on facts. People simply go and rattle off a bunch of information and statistics. If presented well, it might be interesting at the time, but most people don&rsquo;t remember those stats 5 or 10 minutes later (Much less 5 or 10 days).</p>\n\n<p>A better technique is to tell a story. Good stories create &ldquo;knowledge gaps&rdquo; where a few important pieces of information are missing and the audience stays focused to satisfy their curiosity. This improves recollection, but it&rsquo;s still not great.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate communication technique, even beyond story telling is when you can put your audience <em>in</em> the story. When you can get your audience to use their own imaginations to visualize a situation that you paint for them, it triggers all sorts of senses, emotions and responses in people&rsquo;s brains. Studies suggest that when people visualize a situation, their brain goes through nearly the same things it would if they actually experienced it! As you can imagine, this dramatically increases recollection.</p>\n\n<p>I began the presentation with a slide of a young, wealthy, professional-looking couple staring at the audience with an intense, critical look on their faces. Then I painted a picture for the audience including names and occupations of the couple in the picture. I told them to imagine that they were in the middle of a listing presentation with this couple. Then &ldquo;as the gentleman in the picture&rdquo; I asked them a very difficult, probing question about how they would market their home on the Internet. I kept probing them and providing details to make sure they would <em>feel</em> the situation and the stress of being put on the spot. Then I offered an alternative answer and told them to imagine answering the question in that way. Once again, hoping they would feel the confidence of being able to provide such a positive, confident answer to the fictional character&rsquo;s tough question.</p>\n\n<p>They were riveted. It was incredible. It was a situation they had all experienced. It played on fears that they could all relate to. Then it gave them the solution that resolved the situation. They were totally &ldquo;there&rdquo; in that situation.</p>\n\n<p>We then reinforced the same message by having the picture of the same couple on the brochure that we handed them. Essentially, it was almost like an outline of the presentation. It was the best response we&rsquo;ve ever received. The visualization technique seems to be really powerful.</p>","outputFile":"/blog/giving-meaningful-presentations.html","html":"<p>Today will forever change how I approach giving a presentation.</p><p>This morning I had the most successful presentation of my life.

I hope I never forget them.</p><p>First, I stripped it down to the most simple message I could give and still be coherent. (My entire presentation took up 4 slides. There was 1 concept per slide.)</p><p>Second, was how I involved the audience, here&rsquo;s where I want to elaborate&hellip;</p><p>Presenting is about communication. It&rsquo;s not about what you say as the presenter, it&rsquo;s all about what the audience hears and understands.</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible to give a brilliant, eloquent and totally useless speech. People do it all the time. Those types of speeches may leave audience impressed with the presenter&rsquo;s intelligence. But, unless the audience understood his message and can still remember it 2 weeks later. HE FAILED.</p><p>Most presentations focus on facts. People simply go and rattle off a bunch of information and statistics. If presented well, it might be interesting at the time, but most people don&rsquo;t remember those stats 5 or 10 minutes later (Much less 5 or 10 days).</p><p>A better technique is to tell a story. Good stories create &ldquo;knowledge gaps&rdquo; where a few important pieces of information are missing and the audience stays focused to satisfy their curiosity. This improves recollection, but it&rsquo;s still not great.</p><p>The ultimate communication technique, even beyond story telling is when you can put your audience <em>in</em> the story. When you can get your audience to use their own imaginations to visualize a situation that you paint for them, it triggers all sorts of senses, emotions and responses in people&rsquo;s brains. Studies suggest that when people visualize a situation, their brain goes through nearly the same things it would if they actually experienced it! As you can imagine, this dramatically increases recollection.</p><p>I began the presentation with a slide of a young, wealthy, professional-looking couple staring at the audience with an intense, critical look on their faces. Then I painted a picture for the audience including names and occupations of the couple in the picture. I told them to imagine that they were in the middle of a listing presentation with this couple. Then &ldquo;as the gentleman in the picture&rdquo; I asked them a very difficult, probing question about how they would market their home on the Internet. I kept probing them and providing details to make sure they would <em>feel</em> the situation and the stress of being put on the spot. Then I offered an alternative answer and told them to imagine answering the question in that way. Once again, hoping they would feel the confidence of being able to provide such a positive, confident answer to the fictional character&rsquo;s tough question.</p><p>They were riveted. It was incredible. It was a situation they had all experienced. It played on fears that they could all relate to. Then it gave them the solution that resolved the situation. They were totally &ldquo;there&rdquo; in that situation.</p><p>We then reinforced the same message by having the picture of the same couple on the brochure that we handed them. Essentially, it was almost like an outline of the presentation. It was the best response we&rsquo;ve ever received. The visualization technique seems to be really powerful.</p>","preview":"<p>Today will forever change how I approach giving a presentation.</p><p>This morning I had the most successful presentation of my life. It wasn&rsquo;t because it was a big audience or because I wowed them with my wit. It was a short, simple presentation about HouseFLIX to approximately 35 real estate agents at their office. No big deal. But, everybody followed along completely, they understood and connected with what I said, and Travis got a slew of new customers as a result.</p>"},{"slug":"how-to-handle-competition","type":"text","date":"2008-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","title":"How to handle Competition","old_url":"http://joreteg.com/post/98736662/how-to-handle-competition","url":"/blog/how-to-handle-competition","startingFilename":"/Users/henrik/Sites/joreteg.com/posts/2008/02/how-to-handle-competition.html","markdown":"<p>How do you handle competition in a new industry?
