<p>David Allen, the energetic-screwball-genius behind &ldquo;Getting Things Done&rdquo; has one of the simplest approaches to accomplishing goals that&rsquo;s so simple, it borders on stupid.</p>

<p>Imagine this, complex tasks, can be broken down into simple tasks.</p>

<p>What does that mean? Well, let&rsquo;s say I want to learn how to speak French. If I were to put &ldquo;Learn French&rdquo; on my To-do list. It would never happen. In the middle of my hectic day I would look at that item and go&hellip; &ldquo;yeah right!&rdquo; and skip it.</p>

<p>But, if I&rsquo;m really serious about wanting to learn French I should take the time to deconstruct the final goal into simple tasks. That processing is what allows me to fill my to-do list with doable, manageable, understandable tasks that ultimately lead me to my final goal.</p>

<p>Only simplified tasks should make it onto your To-do list if you expect your list to be of any use to you. To-do items need a specific action, such as &ldquo;read and learn 10 new vocab words from <a href="http://www.learnfrench.com">www.learnfrench.com</a>&rdquo;. Then, when you look at your to-do list, you don&rsquo;t have to process how you&rsquo;re going to go about learning French. You&rsquo;ll just perform the pre-planned actions necessary to reach your goal.</p>

<p>Tasks, should be just that. Simple tasks, &ldquo;Learn French&rdquo; is not a task it&rsquo;s a goal. Goals have their place, but the To-do list is not it. If you make the mistake of putting goals on your to-do list odds are that you feel like an unproductive loser when months pass and you can&rsquo;t check them off.</p>

<p>For your own sanity, sense of accomplishment, and happiness keep your task list stupidly simple. What do you do to make your to-do list more productive?</p>
