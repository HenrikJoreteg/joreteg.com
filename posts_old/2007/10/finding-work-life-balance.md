<p>It&rsquo;s not simple. I have a tendency to overwork myself to the point where my work becomes ineffective. It is typically better for me to take a short break and start again thank to just keep pushing. If it were not for my awesome wife reminding me to stop&hellip;I&rsquo;d work from 7am to midnight every day.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to stop long enough to remember why you&rsquo;re working. It&rsquo;s great that I enjoy my work. But when my balance is off I become too one-dimensional. The interesting thing is that the imbalance ultimately hurts my business. Being too focused  mitigates my creativity, makes me far less personable, and severely limits my social life.</p>

<p>If you look at that list you realize that each of those qualities are essential for operating a business:</p>

<p><strong>Creativity -</strong> Essential for innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Being Personable -</strong> Business is about personal connections.</p>

<p><strong>Social Life -</strong> Meeting new people expands your vision and exposes you to people with talents and knowledge that could help you in your business life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that you the only reason you take a break is to help your business. I just think it&rsquo;s cool that it ends up working that way.</p>

<p>Without finding that balance, you&rsquo;ve got nothing worth working for.</p>
