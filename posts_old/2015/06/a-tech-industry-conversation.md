I COULD WRITE THESE FOR THREE DAYS STRAIGHT! it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>\n\n<p>Run a kickstarter for it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kerberos auth to kickstarter, but I&rsquo;ll find my kickstarter video through an incubator I just funded on indiegogo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>\n\n<p>Build a rapid prototype protocol</p>\n\n<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>\n\n<p>I might just use DDP</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>\n\n<p>Into CouchDB</p>\n\n<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>\n\n<p>or&hellip; UDP!</p>\n\n<p>I just need about half the packet-loss and I&rsquo;ll get funded.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s what Theil told me</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>\n\n<p>I hear UDP handshakes better than SSL through a CDN</p>\n\n<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>\n\n<p>Good point</p>\n\n<p>yahoo wants in too.</p>\n\n<p>They killed Pipes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just like Google killed reader</p>\n\n<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>\n\n<p>Beacon API is always better for calling home with.

<p>What follows is an actual SMS conversation I had this evening with Marc Grabanski (with only a few minor edits).</p>

<hr><p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Now we can finally write GWT natively and get the performance</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Greater Web Together™. It&rsquo;s finally living up to its name.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>RxJS is basically making Objective C into Swift that runs in the browser it&rsquo;s great</p>

<p>Imagine a bootstrap that runs Ruby &ndash; mind blowing npm packages made easy</p>

<p>Install them all with a single gulp request &ndash; everything HTTP2 is faster than Python in web storm</p>

<p>Never again will we need flash!</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I heard they&rsquo;re replacing event emitter in node with event machine.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to Dart VM</p>

<p>WebGL is like WebRTC running through twisted &ndash; I mean how else are we going to take ES 2016 to the next level?</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, Dart is the VM that will change the world of evented ColdFusion in a way Flash arduinos never could.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like raspberry pi but with websocket support out of the box. Without the ant build configs.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Oh holy crap ya arduinos are going to change the DEV tools like crazy! Makes them run multi lingual APIs under water.</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Meteor is all over that shit</p>

<p>totes</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, they&rsquo;re inlining react code natively now too.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Well meteor makes it easy to steal lots of credit cards with elastic search based WebKit.</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, but even if you skip meteor I can emulate that with a compromised JSON.stringify method in like 4 nanoseconds.</p>

<p>Just open devtools on the devtools in chrome and run mini mongo and its like getting root at the pentagon. But totally realtime.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Exactly</p>

<p>Buy that stuff with TOR coins</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I only use tor on cat3 cables</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Lol TOR exactly</p>

<p>Never in wifi or else you get massive Unit Tests</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like Silk Road without all the guppies. It&rsquo;s the rebirth of 1337 all over</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Never want to unit test your wifi on Android or else you get super cooled byte code</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Just run it on OpenSauce. Then turn their test machines into a new self-spawning botnet</p>

<p>Game over</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Game overs
  😎</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Some Russian hacker did that. I think she was 3 at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Thrash was her name</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>😆</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Very good at writing killer Visual Basic</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen VB look so much like Cobal in my life wow</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Yeah the hackathon didn&rsquo;t know what hit it.</p>

<p>Heard she wrote it in binary first then wrote some source code as documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Amazing stuff. could crack a DOM API wide open and turn it into Luna</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>The GPU nearly caught fire too.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>GPU was storing way too much SQL though</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Luna!?! Oh shit. You didn&rsquo;t just say that in a text? The Facebook ex-something is totally in Asana getting notifications of these texts right now.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Replicated recursive functions across Ruby shards</p>

<p>Never before have I seen so many manifest files</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I totally base64 and dynamically salt my SQL <em>before</em> it goes into the GPU. That way it&rsquo;s thread safe.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Had to compile Ubuntu into Postgres</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Most people only do it before its stores on SSDs with Flux</p>

<p>True, that&rsquo;s a must</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Bash files all over Redux it was a mess</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Cloudfront deals with that for me though</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Nice</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Keeps it DRY, ya know?!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>I keep VIM DRY as possible</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, also helps if you keep your JSON object oriented. Gang of Four FTW</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>58 key commands Into the module pattern</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I wrote that book</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Only two people with 10 years of living on the web could possibly hack this event loop</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>that’s brave in a world of GIF streaming and dynamic favicons</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Living on the web writing NES emulators that is</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>only if they’re embedding linux</p>

<p>how else would you control all those drones?</p>

<p>use proto buffers?!</p>

<p>raf loops! good call</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>No way</p>

<p>Did you write the book in Go?</p>

<p>I hear Go is like cucumber tests</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Well it was based on open source encryption, so it was partially written. Then npm said they&rsquo;re going public, which ruined those tests.
  &hellip;and my book with &lsquo;em</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>YC doesn&rsquo;t like when you write their books in Go</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I did a series D first, so they didn&rsquo;t mind</p>

<p>Plus, I take dogecoin</p>

<p>So it works out</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Oh wow I&rsquo;ve never had a series D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m only on my 5th SSH tunnel</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Well you already made yours, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Remember BOSH?!?</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Is that like caniuse ?</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Kinda, yeah. I installed a Tesla house battery as a backup for my Triple RAIDed thumb drives.</p>

<p>Problem? Solved.</p>

<p>Bam!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>You must be printing horse js coins like crazy</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna brag. But I&rsquo;m like notch, but I bought a <em>real</em> house.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>The internet of things</p>

<p>Of things you buy with apply pay</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I hired Snoop Dogg to help me install the 3D printed travertine floor tiles.</p>

<p>Of course purchased with Apple Pay</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Awesome was the 3D printer on spotify?</p>

<p>I hear there is a SaaS z-index you can lookup on MDN</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Rdio, but it used flash for a while so, that faded</p>

<p>You just have to use Basic auth and then change the font color so it no longer blends with the background.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Did you make a DSL for that?</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Naw, but i run a grease monkey script though. Then you don&rsquo;t have to think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>It just connects with Bluetooth getUserMedia, I see</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I metaprogrammed the grease monkey script while deploying chaos monkey on Google+ data centers.</p>

<p>Yeah</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>That must have been crazy</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>It was a bit wild, but I was asleep when I wrote it</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>No one ever knew that jQuery had a method to detect heartbeat from a Perl script</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I know!! It&rsquo;s right there!!</p>

<p>Uber uses it</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go run a speed test on my gigabit apple car.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>You can see the data in your apple health app it&rsquo;s all built on CLI algorithms</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>True, it&rsquo;ll be keynoted tomorrow anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>XML RPC is the rage</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Especially on Google Glass</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like FirePhone but cooler</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Ya but the Apple TV is so far ahead because it&rsquo;s on Firebase</p>

<p>Twilio never saw Native script coming</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I heard rumors from watching Silicon Valley that they&rsquo;re thinking about switching to Parse, <em>because</em> of Native Script in Typescript</p>

<p>Just be sure to run it in strict mode or it&rsquo;s like http 1.0 all over again.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Ya that&rsquo;s a real problem with cyclomatic complexity in your semi colons</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>yup, I was getting teapotted with 418s all day before I switched to semi-standard</p>

<p>Just add a grunt task though.</p>

<p>But only if you&rsquo;re on bower</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>No kidding</p>

<p>I always though nHibrinate was the solution for katas</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re right</p>

<p>Saw that on my kanban</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>On run keeper?</p>

<p>I prefer basecamp over fresh books</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I use SPF records whenever I run though.</p>

<p>I have sensitive skin according to my apple watch</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Oh ya the A records really helps when you call a Lyft to get your AirBNB</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Just point a CNAME to gh-pages first, but I totally agree</p>

<p>Jobs and Woz used to always talk about that.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Are those thread safe VR goggles going to crash google hangouts?</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>No one listened though, they were so far ahead like Alan Kay, but with the Newton.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Elixir is kind of like gigabit 4G through Fiddler</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I think they might, they&rsquo;re bastardizing the WebRTC peer connections to stream Internet to the Loon project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so non-standard</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Oh ya like Ionic framework&rsquo;s ACID test</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>That was a game changer.</p>

<p>Just like apple&rsquo;s ear pods</p>

<p>I ran those natively!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>I TDD my beats headphones natively ya - for performance of course</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be like doing BDD if you didn&rsquo;t. This isn&rsquo;t English! It&rsquo;s programming!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna reimplement web components for telnet</p>

<p>But without HTML imports, of course</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you use component JS on Octopress because otherwise people will steal your SSH keys</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>With no babel though</p>

<p>Or else you&rsquo;ll get ES2014</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>VPN into webpack first</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>IT&rsquo;S SO EASY TO DO THIS. I COULD WRITE THESE FOR THREE DAYS STRAIGHT! it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Run a kickstarter for it!</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Kerberos auth to kickstarter, but I&rsquo;ll find my kickstarter video through an incubator I just funded on indiegogo.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Build a rapid prototype protocol</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I might just use DDP</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Into CouchDB</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>or&hellip; UDP!</p>

<p>I just need about half the packet-loss and I&rsquo;ll get funded.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what Theil told me</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>I hear UDP handshakes better than SSL through a CDN</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Good point</p>

<p>yahoo wants in too.</p>

<p>They killed Pipes!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Just like Google killed reader</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Beacon API is always better for calling home with. Otherwise AWS never gets the event data</p>

<p>&ldquo;OK Google&rdquo; amirite?!?</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that GraphQL Siri on a XSS CORS call?</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Think so. But use movable type</p>

<p>Or it KILLS your wifi</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Movable type is built on Functional reactive Pure Script so it&rsquo;s pretty much Ghost</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>With JSP templates, but yeah.</p>

<p>LaTeX is just better anyway</p>

<p>Especially if you use D3 to render it</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Like a mongo elastic search!</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;d run that as a docker container</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>On a Hadoop prerendered iframe</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>But behind nginx</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Never before have I seen so many processors running varnish</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Deploy it with ServiceWorker though. Or you may violate the CSP.</p>

<p>Unless it&rsquo;s MIT licensed.</p>

<p>Varnish is great.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>They were spinning up so many Apache instances that the load balancers couldn&rsquo;t stand it except for in Google Gears running in Unity</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I just wrote an Object tag yesterday that did that but using Iced CoffeeScript so Eich would digg it on HN.</p>

<p>He re-tweeted me on pownce the other day.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Distributed go pros are all the stack overflow credit</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Stream it with EventSource</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s way more reliable that flash media server</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Git tipped on underscore</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t go all TechCrunch Disrupt on me.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Crockford and Eich designed it though</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Crowd funded hackathons?</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Together as friends</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Best friends</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Crock once shipped an MS Word format for fill able PDFs</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t apologize on his controversial white space views so they canned him in a string literal</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Was on a plane with him coming back from FunConf. He told me all about it.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>He was coerced into it</p>

<p>+{} style</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>He was not happy to see so many O'Reilly authors getting slash dotted for Angular directives.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just F# anyway, right?</p>

<p>Plus some syntactic sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Ya but clearly Microsoft wanted to use SQLlite but they shipped CSVs anyways &ndash; Easier to web inspect</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>View source for evah!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Source maps is supposed to solve our code climate CommonJS modules right?</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Do they use the ADB debugging protocol for blackberry 10s browser?</p>

<p>Yup</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Only if you browser sniff</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Works great on new relic</p>

<p>Just orchestrate your code by using esprima to re-write your Python</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Feature test the SASS components</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what django does.</p>

<p>Works like Mocha</p>

<p>(Oh man, this is the most texts I&rsquo;ve sent since I first got my Nest)</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Lol well cappuccino tests objectiveJ In Ember so I&rsquo;m not surprised you can&rsquo;t Ajax more post messages</p>

<p>60fps for life butter smooth requestAnimationFrame Safaris</p>

<p>Exactly <em>proto</em> is accessible on every SVG viewport</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>yeah, i always extract it with restructuring assignments on my closures</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Inheritance call the super method on that ES6 lodash</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>ship it!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Deploy to heroku via Dropbox with a static site generating PDF</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>meme-generators built with semver’ed APNGs, now that smells like a nice unicode character map</p>

<p>anti-aliasing always makes it look better though</p>

<p>that’s why i use typescript to download my web fonts progressively enhancing my UX for my users on gameboy DXes.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why progressive JPGs work so well!</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>that was their Promise, if you will.</p>

<p>but they rarely resolve at all</p>

<p>and they swallow errors like hapi.js when it was using domains!</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Observable generators</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>Object.observe(redis) I always say</p>

<p>or use Mutation Observers</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Built with linked list dust templates</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>yeah, then you can stream ‘em</p>

<p>works ok with SPDY but not HTTP2</p>

<p>subtle but important differences in frame rates if you’re on lie-fi</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Lol</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>i think that’s !important</p>

<p>oh man, i’m fading like a bad jQuery animation</p>

<p>good thing it has a chainable syntax</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Only if you transition the cubic bezier the GsAP 3dmatrix</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>translateZ hacks will help too</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Just return monads</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>object literal monads</p>

<p>textmate 2 for windows</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Never use Symbols through in your Unicode</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>well, yeah, but Symbol.iterator makes more sense to attach as a primitive value if you’re using something like Cocoa</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>My battery is going to die before we finish this lol</p>

<p><strong>Henrik</strong></p>

<p>i’m convinced we could do this for days, we’ve already done it for about an hour longer than i expected to, lol.</p>

<p>good night my friend, i’ve got a plane to catch at an ungodly hour tomorrow 😊</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong></p>

<p>Dependency inject your dreams</p>

<p>Sorry had to do it&hellip;</p>

<hr><p>So <a href="https://twitter.com/1marc">Marc Grabanski</a> invited me to come teach <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/web-apps/">a workshop</a> the last two days for his company <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">Frontend Masters</a> in Minnesota.</p>

<p>Yesterday after the workshop we were chatting about how ridiculous tech terminology has become, and frankly, just the sheer volume of it. We jokingly had a short, seemingly plausible conversations that actually make no sense. The above was a continuation of that. This industry is commically jargony.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/1marc">@1marc</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg">@HenrikJoreteg</a> on the twitters for potentially more random nonsense, but no gurantees.</p>
