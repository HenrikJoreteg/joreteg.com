<p>It’s official, next Monday (Aug 24, 2015) my five and a half year tenure at <a href="http://andyet.com/">&amp;yet</a> is over (Gulp!).</p>

<h2>What’s wrong? What happened?!</h2>

<p>Nothing. Seriously. It’s just been five and a half years and it feels like its time for new adventures.</p>

<p>Things are and will continue to be great at &amp;yet, with lots of interesting clients, lots of <a href="http://andyetconf.com/">cool stuff coming up</a> and I will always <em>highly</em> recommend them as a consulting company.</p>

<p>I’ve had an amazing time at &amp;yet and have very ambivalent feelings about quitting because I &lt;3 my teammates and we’ve had some <a href="https://blog.andyet.com/2011/03/03/devcastle">incredible</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-art-of-experience/arrival-d47000091355">experiences</a> together that are nothing short of priceless.</p>

<p>But sometimes you’ve gotta take a leap and follow your gut.</p>

<h2>So what’s next?</h2>

<p>In the short term, I’m available for independent consulting.</p>

<p>I’ve set up <a href="http://consulting.joreteg.com/">a simple page</a> explaining the types of projects I can help with as well as my rates and availability.</p>

<p>In short, I’m available to start a new project on September 14.</p>
