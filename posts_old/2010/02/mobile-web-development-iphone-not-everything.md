This is from an article on QuirksMode about how we developers are
treating the iPhone web browser much like IE6 when it first came out. We
can’t treat it like it’s the only compatibility check necessary. It’s

again, the web is open by nature. Let’s not pigeonhole ourselves by
overly emphasizing one browser.
