<p>** UPDATE: this plugin works for IE6, IE7 and IE8, not just IE8 as this article suggests **</p>

<p>Every web-developer knows how hard IE sux. IE8 is at least somewhat standards compliant, but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that they&rsquo;re going to drag their feet in implementing all the HTML5 awesomeness that makes the web even more promising than it already is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect solution, but the boys at Google wrote an IE8 plugin called <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/developers_guide.html">Chrome Frame</a> that uses Chrome&rsquo;s rendering engine (Webkit) to render certain pages. As a dev you can sniff for it and prompt them to install it if it&rsquo;s not there. Here&rsquo;s the magic:</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="chrome=1"/&gt;</code></p>

<p>Adding this meta tag will tell IE8 to render the page with Chrome Frame if the plugin is installed.</p>

<p>However, since most IE8 users won&rsquo;t have it installed, (at least at this point) simply adding that tag won&rsquo;t help you too much. So you need to sniff for it and you can prompt the user to install the plugin if it&rsquo;s not present:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"
src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/chromeframe/1/CFInstall.min.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id="placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    CFInstall.check({
        node: "placeholder",
        destination: "http://www.waikiki.com"
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can modify how to prompt the user by changing the configuration, just refer to the <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/developers_guide.html#CFInstall_check_Options">developer documentation</a>. I for one am quite excited about this because it&rsquo;s a way to circumvent Microsoft&rsquo;s slowness in adopting HTML5 and users will simply be prompted to install a plugin, which is an experience they&rsquo;re already used to for flash sites, etc.</p>
