title: Meet your future lightbulb. This LED lasts 45,000 hours and is bright enough to replace a 40w bulb. I don&rsquo;t think you can buy them just yet though. LEDs are awesome and waaaay more enviromentally friendly because they don&rsquo;t contain mercury, like CFLs. Not to mention they last longer and consume a fraction of the energy.
