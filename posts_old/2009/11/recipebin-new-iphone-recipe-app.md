<p>My wife was looking for a good way to organize her recipes, naturally I thought it would be cool to have it on the web, or her iPhone or something. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that I liked.</p>

<p>All the apps I saw were over-engineered and even simple tasks like adding a new recipe were unnecessarily complicated. So I figured I&rsquo;d build one in my spare time. I was looking for an excuse to learn how to use jQTouch anyways.</p>

<h3>Here were my main goals:</h3>

<ol><li>Web-based, but iPhone optimized. I wanted to easily be able to type in new recipes using a real keyboard on my computer and then view/edit them anywhere from the web or my iPhone.</li>
<li>I really wanted solid iPhone support for viewing recipes (preferably other high-end smartphones as well, like Palm Pre and Android). This is because I don&rsquo;t want to be forced to put my laptop on a messy kitchen counter with food everywhere.</li>
<li>Super easy, or non-existant sign-up process.</li>
<li>Delicious interface.</li>
</ol><h3>What I didn&rsquo;t care about:</h3>

<ol><li>IE support - this is a free app. I built it for me and IE doesn&rsquo;t support any of the fun CSS3 stuff, so frankly, I don&rsquo;t care if it looks terrible in IE. I don&rsquo;t wanna mess with it because I&rsquo;m not getting paid for this and supporting IE would be way too much work. It&rsquo;ll work in IE it&rsquo;ll just be ugly.

<li>Social features - I may add some of this stuff later, but for now I just want a good, simple bucket for storing my own stuff.</li>
<li>Complex functionality like unit conversions for measurements, etc. Doing this requires users to enter stuff in a more structured format which makes entering recipes harder than it needs to be.
