<p>This post is different than most of my posts in that there&rsquo;s nothing cool or sexy about it. It&rsquo;s about comfort while dealing with having to work with an old windows system.</p>

<p>I have been living in Mac land for so long, that I didn&rsquo;t even realize that some of these changes were possible. I just chalked it up to Microsoft&rsquo;s way of punishing the people that use their systems.</p>

<p>God bless lifehacker for <a href="http://lifehacker.com/149003/avoid-computer-eye-strain">their write-up of this</a>, you <em>can</em> fix some of the annoyances of windows to reduce eye strain and avoid staring at ugly pixelated text.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>: Turn on Clear Type: Go to Display -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Effects and make sure you check the &ldquo;Use the following method to smooth edges of screen fonts&rdquo; and set it to &ldquo;ClearType&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>: Crank up the refresh rate on your monitor: Go to Display -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced, then look for a setting for the screen refresh rate. Mine looked as follows, it was set on 60hz i put it on 75, which was the highest it would go. These two changes will reduce eye strain&hellip; highly recommended if you spend a lot of time staring at an XP system.
