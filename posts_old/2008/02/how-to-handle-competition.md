<p>How do you handle competition in a new industry? If you&rsquo;re one of the first in a new and appealing market, you&rsquo;re doubtlessly going to experience imitators. It shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraging. If anything, it&rsquo;s a compliment. We&rsquo;re experiencing that at HouseFLIX.</p>

<p>It means we&rsquo;re doing something right and something worth copying and that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t feel immediately threatened by any of our competitors, but a problem occurs if enough new emergents appear and there are no clear leaders. Because, then it becomes a proven and attractive new market for a bigger company with far greater resources. If there are no clear leaders, then they&rsquo;ll design their own system and cherry-pick the best strategy rather than buy anyone out. That&rsquo;s no good for any of the smaller players.</p>

<p>The big companies experience similar situations all the time. Look at Microsoft&rsquo;s offer to buy Yahoo. They decided that they have to merge resources in order to give Google a worthy competitor in the online advertising industry.</p>

<p>Perhaps smaller companies have to learn to do the same.</p>
